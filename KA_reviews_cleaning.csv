0,i frequently fly to kinshasa and chose this time to use kenya airways as their business class was the cheapest available and the flight was from heathrow only ten minutes from home the seat was comfortable enough but the inflight entertainment was limited cabin crew on the outward flights were charming and attentive but rather dour on the return flight flight delays were a feature of the trip with nbofih delayed by an hour then fihnbo delayed by 12  hours with no explanation it meant missing my nbolhr connection and waiting for 16 hours in nairobi airport luckily i was in business class so could spend the wait in the wellappointed lounge in future although it is more expensive i will stick to brussels airlines
1,05 oct 2023 londonnairobi we are a couple and booked mid 2023 for tickets departing london kq103 at 1110 am kenya airways deliberately put us on flight kq101 departing 1825 no prior notification long before as it is the rule on same day 5 oct morning as we were on the way to the airport we noticed an email for the online checkin with the change of time  6 hours waiting at lhr missing correspondence to our final destination and yet flight kq101 at 1110 am did operate and left london at that time we raised claimincident created 13 oct 2023 after resisting emails from us with objective and justified case after a first odd reply and full of non sense from kenya airways they offered us a compensation of 600 eur per person while requiring a list of documents from us we sent all documents they required  15 nov 2023Â  kq confirmed good receipt of our documents all correct and assured payment to take over 2 months and we are yet to see the amount back in our account no answer we had sent 5 reminders we also noticed on kq customer space our case as incident closed 3 mar 2024 at last email from kenya airways pretending excuse and announced  payment is actively under process for a simple bank transfer 5 months on 16 mar 2024 still no money to our account
2,my recent experience with kenya airways was incredibly disappointing during a transit from nairobi to addis ababa the airline made a critical mistake resulting in us missing our connecting flight despite having a transit time of only one hour and 40 minutes we were left stranded at the airport for over 24 hours without any proper assistance after the airline acknowledged their error they offered no immediate solution or support we were left to fend for ourselves with no food provided and no accommodation arranged forcing us to sleep on uncomfortable chairs in the waiting area attempts to seek assistance from the manager were futile as no help was provided furthermore the lack of options for purchasing food at reasonable prices within the airport coupled with restrictions on bringing food from outside only added to our frustration this experience not only caused significant inconvenience but also led to me missing out on a special occasion i strongly advise against using kenya airways and urge fellow travelers to consider alternative options the lack of basic care and assistance during such a distressing situation is unacceptable and i have no intention of flying with this airline again
3,delayed and cancelled flights so arrived 10 hours later that originally expected given 2 samosas and offered a breakfast because of missing my connecting flight and having to wait 7 hours  the food packaging was ripped and some of the breakfast removed everything was cold old and dry the attendant were uninterested and offered little information or help arrived in manchester to hear that my luggage was still in kenya so i had to wait 2 days for it to arrive with no warm clothes or shoes and no medication
4,kigali to amsterdam via nairobi 4th feb 2024 ticket cheap promotional purchased instantly after kq resumed their nbo flights to china via bangkok trip started well checkin in kgl clear though tedious 2040 minutes per person in skypriority line luggage inscribed the whole way inclusive of an additional leg to hanoi on another ticket with vietnam airlines another skyteam alliance member that would ease my transfer in bkk later the trip became an unreasonable lengthy odyssey over 4 days due to just a two hours delayed departure from kgl i missed connection nbobkk which was closed at gate or cancelled i have different information on this first kq sent me from the now closed gate 11 in nbo to gate 8 to board with qatar airways to doh and then to han final destination however i had to decline as only nbodoh was booked and acknowledged by qr the remaining sector was not booked and qr refused to book me through to hanoi then i had to queue up at kqtransfer desks who eventually told me that they alternatively would provide me hotel in kenya until their next departure 2 days later  on top they further needed a supervisors approval to this long stay i would go on next direct flight but had to await ticket reissuance in the meantime they sent me to their prime lounge in nbo to wait for details went airsidelandsideairside and had to endure 2 security checks the details dragged on however at 4 am i was without any dialogue laconically sent a rebooked itinerary nboams by kq and then amsbkk by klm that detour implied a 23 times longer trip with arrival in bkk a day later than planned they then saved on hotels but added on flight costs i thought i better accept this solution as to discuss options seemed not easy and i was too tired to make a fuss and would then arrive a day earlier than feared those two trips went well i narrowly managed transfer in ams but my luggage was not following me it apparently stayed on in nairobi this i arrived bkk without my luggage it only arrived there with kqs own flight the following day i had in the meantime postponed and rebooked my onwards tickets with vietnam airlines who of course could not sent my luggage with me as it had not yet arrived bangkok yet however vn did a great job to retrieve it and eventually submitted it to my private address in vietnam upon an extra day and some ongoing actions from my side not to the benefit of kenya airways flight 1 apart from the delay it was a fine trip on a well occupied b737800 lounge in kigali was accessed through my flying blue gold card and was a pleasure food is good including several hot dishes and savory snacks drink options are very sparse but well stocked as usual gate calls in kigali are done way too early and even before arriving aircrafts have landed if adhered to one would sit in the dull gate area for 12 hours instead of enjoying the lounge to a maximum thus i refused to be chased out of lounge early as there were no reason to rush for nothing boarding easy onboard i got my wanted seat and preordered seafoodmeal wines onboard are drinkable as compared to those served in the lounge flight 2 a boeing 787 aircraft a bit worn on time flight was not full i was given three seats to flat out as i was deprived sleep struggling in the airport the previous night flight crew were very good two full meal servings ife is ok
5,all legs on this flight were delayed from johannesburg to accra the journey took 18 hours and from accra to johannesburg it took 20 hours staff seldom gave correct information on the left from accra to nairobi we asked the crew how much longer she replied an hour and a half within 5 minutes the captain states we are ready to descend
6,he boarding was late the service onboard very average for a business class product connecting flight was chaotic onboard services hardly had options what is concerning is the captain of the flight had his 2 sons on the flight from nairobi to cape town and allowed them access to the cockpit for both take off in nairobi and landing in cape town on kq784 for 18 january so not even safety is respected
7,his is our first time flying with kenya airways  will be the last we are in africa for a 25th anniversary trip  we were flying kq flight 471 from kigali to nairobi on 19th jan 2024 we arrived at the airport at 7 am for the 910 am flight minutes after takeoff the pilot announced that we were returning to the gate as a door latch wasnt closing  they needed to have it looked at at around 10 am after half an hour sitting on the flight they said we needed to get off  they would give us an update after sitting around for 3 hours at 1 pm we were told that we would be put on a flight at 7 pm and that they were going to bus us to a hotel for lunch  to wait we had a flight to zanzibar at 630 pm on jan 19th but since we werent even supposed to leave kigali till 7 pm we knew we would not make our connection the kenya airways rep assured all of us that all of us would automatically be booked onto connecting flights  we didnt have to worry about a thing since matters were out of our hands at that time we left with our fellow passengers  were taken to a not so nice hotel where we were told to have lunch  wait for an update at around 5 pm the reception informed us that kenya airways had updated them that we were no longer going on the 7 pm flight but were going to be out on a 340 am flight to nairobi the next day january 20th it would be more 17 hours past our original departure time but we had no option but to wait it out as our bags were still at the airport somehow we all made it to 1 am at night when a bus arrived to take us back to kigali airport upon arrival we were told that the 340 am flightkq 479 was delayed till 440 am to make things even more chaotic our connecting flight to zanzibarkq 490 was also already delayed from 8 am to 1120 am im writing this as i sit at the airport hoping to finally get to zanzibar today the total flight time from kigali to nairobi  nairobi to zanzibar is 3 hours or so and thanks to kenya airways we have already spent 27 hours at the airport  the hotel  we still dont know if we will actually get to zanzibar today and if our bags will be on the zanzibar flight time will tell its only now that im reading all the terrible reviews of kenya airways we experienced the terrible customer service first hand with agents not having any replies to questions absolutely no apologies from any staff for the agony caused and long lines of angry customers at every counter the horror stories are real avoid this airline like the plague if you value your peace of mind anyone can understand one aircraft having operational issues but from what we saw and experienced cancellations delays no accountability  no apologies are a daily way of life for kenya airways how can an airline get it so wrong so many times bottom linerun as fast as you can from kenya airways you will thank yourself that you did if you still choose to book with them after reading all these reviews well you were warned
8,absolutely disgusting service our outbound flight from johannesburg in december 2023 was delayed by 8 hours only to land in nairobi and be delayed a further hour on arrival in bangkok our luggage was missing no help response or apology from kenya airways fortunately bangkok luggage staff sorted out the issue after 4 days our return flight from bangkok started with no sign of any staff at the closed boarding gate until 2 hours before an international flight patrons were left confused and uncertain of what next to do or if they could eat etc on arrival at nairobi in january 2024 our flight to johannesburg was once again delayed the staff are arrogant and not helpful horrible experience
9,do yourself a favour and dont ever fly kenya airways the airline didnt load any of the passengers luggages onto the flight from nairobi to cape town which we later found from other passengers online that it is a frequent occurrence to anywhere neither did they inform the arrival airport so passengers were left waiting more than 3 hours after landing wondering what caused the baggage delay to rub salt to the wound kenya airways did not provide any update on luggages and was practically uncontactable via phone its official whatsapp email social media messenger so we were left stranded with very little on us and no idea at all if our luggages will ever be delivered they did eventually deliver after 34 days followup calls for documentation for insurance purposes also hit a brick wall the airline simply ignores all customer service requests do yourself a favour and do not fly with kenya airways despite their promise of being customer centric its all a lie and facade ts simply not worth the anguish that you will experience
10,worst experience ever and the hostesses wasnt helpful first flight from dubai to nairobi was delayed more than one hour second flight from nairobi to johannesburg delayed again charger on flight was not working my food was disgusting no communication as to why flight was delayed and no indication of time of departure i requested to move my seat and i was told no arriving in johannesburg my luggage wasnt on the flight i had to wait 3 days to get my suitcase from the airline as it was left in dubai being on vacation its absolutely horrid not having my personal essentials yesterday 5 january my flight was delayed  flight to nairobi was full and again very helpless hostesses arrived late at nairobi for the next flight and they made us wait 1 and a half hours late for departure no explanation as to why i paid for the economy comfort seats on both flights second flight was horrid charger for my phone wasnt working again and when i informed the air hostess she asked me what do i want her to do about it if its not working its not working asked for a blanket 4 times before eventually getting one
11,Â  Â worst experience ever they change boarding and flight time without considering of the customers last minute changes also changing flights for long hours without providing an alternative solution you can never trust them since one doesnt know what to expect the airline is full of surprises
12,the worst airline you can opt for i started from mumbai last week that flight was delayed and they were not intimation it to to me i had a connection flight to kilimanjaro last minute they changed my flight to another carrier same way i have been kept on dark about when my flight will depart for mumbai as everybody including their staff are clueless
13,poor customer service and losing passenger luggage 2 weeks on still waiting on my luggage every time i call the customer service line i am advised that they dont have an update on my luggage the staff are rude and dont know how to respond to questions kq please put this as a disclaimer that a passengers luggage may not arrive at their destination your baggage contact line 254203274747 is as good as not having a phone number as it doesnt work if you want economy flight with zero customer service and dont care about losing your luggage this is the best airline for it
14,i write this with so much anger and pain my flight has been delayed for almost the whole day and i have a child i will have to stay at nairobi airport from 8am  10pm just to wait for a transfer least to say previously my luggage was delayed by 2hrs to arrive lost items at the airport i never learnt my lesson this is the last time i will be using kenya airways
15,it is the worst airline 2 hours delay at departure 20 hours layover without the least assistance or consideration of clients i had to wait for my departure from nairobi to douala the 12th december 2023 at 730am after i slept on the chair since 2pm on the 11 december that i arrived in kenya airport just to discover again that my flight is delayed for another 2 hours to douala i will not count the mediocrity of the ground staff at the airport in nairobi that are not even ready to assist travelers it took 3 staff 2 hours to tell me if the agency has some arrangements for me here at the airport because they are busy pressing their mobile phones and answering calls in their native languages i witnessed many clients missed their flights because the ground staff were too too slow in serving them
16,14 hour flight and i genuinely enjoyed my experience from start to finish my flight ran smoothly and on time my luggage was never mishandled the staff were warmkind helpful accommodating and attentive to everybody on board and even paid extra attention to families with young childreninfants the food was great i looked forward to every meal in my experience what makes kenya airways stand out the most is the level of care they provide to their customers the next time i fly to nairobi i am making sure to choose kenya airways
17,flew darnbokgl 25 nov 2023 on embraer 190 got all the nice perks of holding elite status with skyteam checkin in dar was easy and cooperative dar has improved tremendously immigration and security provided quick services good new cip lounge in dar with quality craftdraft beer the kq lounge in nairobi is always a breeze onboard given reserved seats two drink rounds in each of these two short flights i had preordered seafood and given options of crab salad sandwich and salmon sandwich nice indeed fair wines served luggage allowance generous 3 x 23 kg we had 5 suitcases checked in almost 120 kg inscribed without extra charges the cases were arrived perfectly at final destination flights on time transit in nairobi went smooth as well onboard fas were helpful kind and on top of things proactively asking if we needed extra catering or refill ife was simple with individual miniscreens and movie options cant fault anything really seems i am getting a sweet spot for kenya airways tickets inexpensive and was further given flyer miles and tier points instantly towards requalify for my gold card very good value for money
18,kigali via nairobi to dar november 23 2 short regional flights first on a b738 next on embraer 190 benefitted a lot by being a skyteam gold card holder got the best seats and access to lounges in kigali dar nairobi which all are good varied with improved hot food options boarding easy and quick onboard enjoyed special meals preordered and given on both flights an impressive gesture skyteam priority worked to some extend onboard not recognised as elite status holder but cannot complain as we were fairly well pampered call bell was answered if running short 1st flight had serious landing attempts in nairobi before succeeding worst nightmare was a repeated delay on flight nbodar a technical issue reoccurred even on a substituted aircraft instated eventually we took off but upon worries expressed by captain we became forced to return back to nairobi despite we were almost already at dar 150 passengers then had to sit in the aircraft or debark into a bus on the tarmac in nairobi there were no proper announcements no service no toilet access just waiting in limbo for hours some passengers refused to reboard as they lost faith in the airline and aircraft then these passengers luggage had to be offloaded another hour went by the whole night was completely destroyed however at last we took off but only arrived in dar early morning instead of at midnight as scheduled five hours delay is serious and favour direct flights avoiding transits the good thing was that we and luggage as well finally arrived and in one piece for both flights fas and passengers were in general cooperative extrovert and sociable
19,zurichparisnairobijoburg on 1718 sep 23 on two boeing 787800 1st leg operated by their skyteam partner air france boarding issued prior to departure from zurich seamless checkin and transfers onboard food is improving ordered seafood meal and it was accommodated with pleasure and of good taste two meal services provided on the 8 hour flight to nairobi drinks plenty champagne and 4 acceptable wines only 1 beer offered tusker lager which is waterish cheap and useless lost 1 of 2 inscribed bags but it is being recovered kenya airways did not load it from nairobi for the last leg lounge access provided throughout all were good ife and wifi fine not world class but suffice fas are good not patronising passengers flexible and humorous especially the announcements were quite charming and funny transfer in nairobi easy even though disembarking included some walking and bussing good product not overkill but sufficient and less expensive than their competitors love their business class not because it is extravagant but the cabin space their crew and solid food provision is adorable
20,it is truly distressing for such a large company to see a total lack of respect and communication towards customers i dont know if this is the case for other destinations outside the drc kinshasa but the service is really disappointing no luggage received and that without any explanation or apology out of a total of 11 suitcases none arrived and we then have to run after the company to get crumbs of information if the person receiving is willing and in the mood the lack of consideration from customers is really disappointing its sad to see that the pride of africa slogan is only limited to the paint on planes and in advertising spots  il est vraiment dÃ©solant pour une compagnie aussi grande de constater un manque total de respect et communication envers les clients je ne sais pas si cest le cas pour dautres destinations en dehors de la rdc kinshasa mais le service est vraiment decevant aucun bagages reÃ§u et Ã§a sans aucune explication ni excuses sur un total de 11 valises aucune nest arrivÃ©e et nous devons par la suite courir derriÃ¨re la compagnie pour avoir des miettes dinformations si la personne qui reÃ§oit est disposÃ© et dhumeur le manque de considÃ©ration des clients est vraiment decevant cest triste de voir que le slogan de pride of africa ne se limite quÃ  la peinture sur les avions et dans les spots publicitaires
21,dreadful airline  after emailing customer service to say both my wife and i had no entertainment system as both were broken and then no choice of food as they had run out  customer service totally uninterested and not replied had our money and dont care avoid
22,the lady at checkin was very rude and insisted on wanting to check in my colleague on a 4am flight with no alternative accommodation but a mere 200usd and we  rejected the offer as it excluded accommodation she refused to call the manager when we requested her to and brazenly carried on until we confronted her again only after waiting for 55 minutes then my colleagues seat was secured and we went through the boarding gates as if that wasnt enough the departure time was 30min late and no apology was received from the captain to use kenya airways was the biggest blunder on my side ever committed i am a frequent flyer and have never experienced such a distasteful and shabby treatment ever i vow never to use this airline again
23,dismal from start to end not all of the staff and crew were rude some were just sullen and disinterested food was consistently awful drinks were ok the hard product isnt too bad similar to what turkish used to operate ie dated but comfortable enough but everything else was dreadful  checkin lounges boarding etc all service points were very poor nairobi airport was an awful experience all 4 times we had stopovers in both directions expect corruption chaos and disorganisation ill do all i can to avoid kenya airways in future
24,airline was 1 hour late to board passengers and to 1 hour late to depart without any explanation food was horrible and to make matters worse they lost the entire passengers luggage without any explanation the swiss port employee who was left to deal with the passengers had no clue what was going on and all he could do was give us forms to fill out all perishable items that i carried will now be trashed since the man said the earliest we could get our bags is wednesday 824 a passenger on the same flight who had air tagged her luggage indicated that the bag was still at jkia last month they also lost my husbands luggage and when they tracked it it was discovered to be at the delta baggage office still in new york instead of kenya 4 days later when it was delivered they did not even bother to refund us
25,kenya airways has really disappointed me for a second time its never on time it appears 30_40 minutes late am supposed to be setting off to uganda from kenya but the plane is not even here same applies from dubai we left 26 minutes late that was even before we boarded
26,jnbnboamszrh on 1415 august 23 flights on time despite being quite full good announcements check in on transfer desk in joburg all 3 bps issued on spot kenya now uses the south african airlines lounge which is very high class lounge with sleepers and a very diverse buffet with high quality foods the long haul flights were both on boeing 7879 business class is wonderfully furnished spacious in 2x2x2 configuration which is perfect low chair fenders allow you to overlook entire cabin when seated upright very ample leg space in the lieflats spent night in pride lounge nairobi preordered hot seafood meals were provided thrice on the two flights all different variants and tasty takeoff champagne given not the most sublime business class catering in the skies food in general is not extraordinary apart from the preorder options no beer choices only the watery national tusker lager offered meals robust and reliable preordered meal managed well fas active and smiley though not well coordinated despite being many ife is acceptable though narrow choices on movies nice beds with mattresses and pillows 2 blankets per seat will fly again with kq klms 52 lounge in amsterdam is huge and good they printed out coming boarding passes for me amsterdamzurich on embraer 190 aircraft operated by klm well synchronised with kenya airways and under their flight number flight full delayed Â½ hour due to complicated tedious loading of two giant dogs a serious unnecessary delay causing delay for 200 people catering was surprisingly good menu card nice large food box with 3 course meal including my favoured seafood meal champagne 4 wines and lots of hot and soft drinks offered swift service seats are just economy seats but i was given 2 seats in front row and cant complain
27,officially the worlds worst airline 3hr  delay from sa to burundi and coming home they call you to board and then tell you your flight is delayed by 2hrs no compensation rude cheeky staff with no customer service they try to push the blame to customers and have a serious attitude issue everything about the airline is so disappointing from the aircraft to the meals to the staff to the compensation been on the airport for more than 10hrs no empathy for ppl they tell you to book a hotel at your own expense and they cant even accommodate ppl in lounges pathetic stay away from this airline
28,the worst service i have ever encountered in airline my fiancÃ© missed her flight 4 times due to overbooking of airline airport workers keep on sending her back home saying that the airplane is full i wonder how if you can treat your staff like that how can you put up to 7 passengers waiting for more than 4 days or why would you issue staff tickets yet you know the plane is full 30 minutes before the gates closes the we can see that you can even issue tickets the flight has up to 10 seats free and still you decide not to give your staff a seat i do not ever recommend anyone to use kenya airways
29,do not use kenya airways this was the worst decision ive ever made i had two flights one from mombasa to nairobi which was delayed 4 hours so i almost missed my second flight home to london then i got there and they delayed it by an hour meaning it was 1255pm then they told us they were delaying it till the next day at midday the organisation was appalling got to a hotel room at 4am which wasnt cleaned at all and they didnt even give me a key card for my hotel room the flight then also got delayed another 2 hours the next day
30,i had the worst experience with them i cant even explain my frustration the night of my departure they told us 2 hours delay then another 3 hours then they said you know what its cancelled they booked me another flight the next day i reached to dubai and the next flight was already gone by then
31,we travelled from mauritius to south africa with a connection flight in nairobi in mauritius weve checked in all 3 of our bags at the same time upon arrival in johannesburg south africa we were informed that my sons bag stayed behind in mauritius theyve done a tracking on the barcode and informed us that the bag never arrived in nairobi either how can you just leave the bag behind pathetic service
32,"
we had flown in from dubai to nairobi on business class and it was good hence on our way back i decided to upgrade and fly business class expecting the same it was the biggest mistake in my life the so called business class was just close to the premium economy of most other airlines seats had some push back and thats it the leg extender was stuck and wont extend cabin crew said they were helpless  they didnt even try to see if it can be worked i had to spend the entire flight sitting upright cos without the leg extender to support i was slipping down if i reclined the seat horrible experience and to top it all there event wasnt a tv on the 5 hour 20 minute flight cabin crew said that this aircraft only has so much facility and they were looking at each other and smiling when they heard that i actually upgraded to business class i would like to know how i can claim a refund where and how can i escalate this matter to i sent a dm on twitter to the airline which they havent responded such daylight robbery must not be permitted this isnt the upgrade we pay for i am going to share my horrible experience on all social media channels interestingly i have not received any survey about my flight experience which they promptly send never flying kenya airways again"
33,one of the worst airlines i travelled on kq765 delayed out of jhb with no reason given only left at 0230 on sunday morning 25 june in stead of 0115 missed our connection flight out of nairobi to zanzibar ground staff made us wait for 3 hours before we got any assistance in nairobi eventually got a precision flight to zanzibar after we had to fight the staff for seats we were assured that the flight will have our baggage on it as it was scheduled to leave 3 hours after we got our seats when we arrived in zanzibar we had no baggage and the ground staff was rude saying it was not their fault we did not have our baggage and that it would be at the zanzibar airport on sunday evening with the next flight and if we want it we can come fetch it then we where on honeymoon and our hotel is 1 hour 20min away from the airport as we booked a all inclusive package which included our transfer to and from the hotel we had no means to get back to the airport to collect our bags we requested that they please deliver the bags to the hotel ground staff said they can only deliver on monday morning when we asked for compensation to get some necessities like toothbrush and clean clothes as we had no clothes or toiletries and had a dinner reservation for sunday evening we were told it is not their problem nor their fault our baggage did not arrive and they rushed us out of their office needless to say we did not receive our baggage that evening monday morning 26 june i phoned the lost baggage office and was told the delivery will only start work at around 1000 and would need to make a few stops before he gets to us we ended up getting our baggage at 1500 monday afternoon missing the whole sunday and most of monday of our vacation because of having no clothes
34,where near does this airline come to being called the pride of africa it has made us as kenyans embarrassed the flight itself delayed for over 4 hours with no valid explanation nor any compensations no regrets no apologies the cabin crew are probably the rudest youll ever come across as if they are doing you a favor no courtesy and concerns for the three infants and 1 elderly i was traveling with on the contrary we were begging for the very basics and still not provided like infant food inspire of prearranged meals non of my infants got the baby meals the aircraft they are using is not for long distance international flights as the seats are extremely compact and zero legroom we came out of the flight tired and exhausted as if we had been in war ground crew at both the airports equally the same and no sense of responsibility check in experience 15 hours just to check in my family of 5 adults and 3 babies how in the world can you explain this cabin smells stale from previous flight and nothing fresh this is the worst airline ive ever travelled in
35,ver use this airline original flight had a 2 hour layover it was canceled and the new flight had a 8 hour layover nowhere comfortable to sit as the dont give you access to the pride lounge but only a food voucher with no food selection but a set meal staff have a terrible attitude and not bothered to help i will never use this kenya airways again
36,the flight on return journey was excellent a sumptuous fish menu provided on my return yesterday staff are caring and lovely to talk to i watched a cookery show and learnt a recipe on flight also a construction show though took it off half way due to the swearing there wasnt much to watch for me but i left happy learning a potato recipe from south africa a bit of a delay in nairobi for an hour but as i was on holiday it didnt spoil any plans i spoke to a lady going to usa and she was given accommodation for missing connecting flight so not so bad my issue seems mild but one that all schools are aware of in london we had a nut snack and i did hope that those with nut allergies where considered at my childrens 3 schools we simply remove nuts from children packed lunch or school dinners and from view as some people get very bad allergies maybe it was the type of nuts served but i was surprised to see nuts on the menu
37,my family of 4 people had booked to fly from glasgow to nairobi thru amsterdam on 26 th june 2023 as they were preparing to fly they received a message that the flight from glasgow to amsterdam is cancelled thus the rebooking is done for 2 people on 26 th and the other 2 on 27 th june that would have messed all our onward plans as today is a sunday we never got any response from the agent in scotland who booked the tickets as a last resort with a prejudiced mind that i am just gambling i called kenya airways number the response i received was absolutely amazing we got rebooking from edinburgh to amsterdam to reach nairobi as planned earlier i am really thankful
38,i had booked a return flight from copenhagen to mombasa and back unfortunately i missed my connecting flight going to mombasa i booked another flight to mombasa and i immediately contacted kenya airways customer support to find a solution for my return flight i wrote and called them for a week before i heard back from kenya airways fortunately the reply was in writing that my return ticket was confirmed when i went to mombasa airport to fly back they could not find my ticket i showed them the email with the confirmation and the kenya airways lady in mombasa agreed that it said my ticket was confirmed head office refused to let me onboard unless i purchased a new ticket i did so to come home to my family and i was advised to contact customer service when i got back to get my money back then followed several months where i have been writing with kenya airways customer support all sort of excuses came up claiming i had the wrong visa to me being a student and other lies finally they concluded that in reality i had not purchased a new ticket instead i had paid a penalty fee for missing my original flight i then provided kenya airways with a copy of my receipt from mombasa airport that clearly states that i had to my a new ticket since then kenya airways have ignored my emails i am really shocked how kenya airways has tried to avoid taking responsibility and done so by lying bullying and inventing stories to make me drop my claim i followed every procedure the moment i missed my plane and i truly trusted and believed kenya airways when they wrote me that my ticket was confirmed the lesson learned is apparently that you cannot trust kenya airways
39,i have been flying with kenya airways for the past 6 years experienced a delay once which was okay but i had the worst experience in may where both trips were a disappointment first on the 14th may my departure was delayed from 6am to 4pm no apologies nothing they kept on rescheduling the flight without proper communication we late boarded emirates to nairobi again it took us hours to board from nairobi to mombasa i was supposed to arrive at mombasa 11am on the 14th sunday but we arrived 2am on the 15th mondayworst scenario was on 28th may my flight was scheduled at 845pm to nairobi then connecting flight at 1145pmi arrived on time waited on the queue reaching the counter am told my flight was rescheduled to 7pm on the screen i could see clearly my flight displayed at 845pmseriously  without even sending a notification remember while booking phone number and email address is always part of the reservation details the staff showed no remorse and asked me to check with reservation team i walked politely to kq office i was so shocked when the reservation agent told me that my ticket is not valid that its just a paper  so from changing the time to my ticket being void this was the worst respond ever kenya airways staff lie a lot he even told me that they tried to send a notification of which he wasnt sure after insisting for a whole one hour a supervisor later checked me in and i boarded the 845pm flight they booked me a hotel in nairobi and i had to board my flight at 5pmi missed my reporting day at work it was my last time boarding kenya airways such a shame
40,at a time when many airlines are improving their product kenya airways appears to be going in the opposite direction getting onto the aircraft in nairobi was chaotic with no priority given to business passengers  for the airline sky priority means nothing from the boarding gate we then went on a long bus journey around the airport before returning to part of the terminal to climb up stairs to get onto the aircraft although the cabin crew were very pleasant and offered a preflight drink champagne water or apple juice no more drinks were served until after the meal arrived this was a total disappointment with my beef option consisting of two small pieces of beef some sauce and a mini samosa it was complemented with a glass of wine in a thimblesized glass which was only refilled when we asked the crew one of the mysteries of the flight was why the lavatory at the front of the aircraft permanently had an engaged light on when we asked we were told that the captain had said that it was reserved for the crew and passengers could not use it another mystery was a man who spent the entire flight sat on the crew jumpseat in the middle of the business section i asked him what he was doing and he explained that the crew could not find me anywhere to sit given that airlines flying into the uk have a legal obligation to provide advance passenger information 24hours before arrival it would be interesting to know how this requirement was met although the aircraft was clean and the flight was smooth kenya airways 787 are let down by their oldstyle sidebyside seating which was worn and in some cases not functioning properly the fact that the flight was full suggests that the airline has no problem selling tickets and therefore little incentive to improve its product
41,his is a bad airline i travelled with kenya airways on the 20th of may 2023 and now is the 26 may 2023 and l havent received my bag i was told the bags were left in kenya i have made several phone calls to zimbabwe and also here l have visited their office in dubai they are not giving mey bag this is my last time to travel with kenya airways
42,missed outward leg of a return flight due to issue with ka website accepted loss here though honestly feel website more than 50 responsible problem was return leg automatically cancelled engaged from two weeks before flight with what is inexplicably called customer support and still had to pay again at the last minute to get a flight back to nairobi total loss considerably more than the original return flight total sent at least 8 messages to customer support initial replies reassuring and seemed to offer resolution but nothing happened reassurances turned out to be misleading and the information i needed was never offered customer service agents while courteous and polite seem to assume that customers will have an understanding of the rules and practices of the dystopian ka universe no useful information is provided it also appears that agents do not have the authority to actually resolve anything therefore they do not really engage with an issue but dole out meaningless bland reassurances to get a flight it required a very long and expensive phone call with an agent who had to constantly refer to a supervisor thankfully there are alternatives to ka both externally and internally
43,y good flight excellent crew on board as was the food and drink my only gripe is the business class seats could do with an update but they are comfortable none the less
44,kigali  nairobi  entebbe return 2627 march 2023 aircraft were narrowbodies the first flight was on a b737 while the three remaining flights were on e190s all four shorthaul flights were on time this was a mileage run to retain my flying blue gold status as it otherwise was going to expire by end of the month i was at first travel attempt denied boarding and my ticket was suspended by a junior staff in kigali they said upon liaising with immigration i airport that my reason to travel was not valid i tried to change purpose but the damage was done which forced me to postpone the entire trip however later i had the ticket reissued by kq town office in kigali who were professional and committed to help without any payments as it was not a no show case they even took over the booking from my travel agent which was effective and great relief avoiding potential additional costs i even got a much better and more expensive itinerary avoiding nightflights though extending my transit lounge stays while the junior kq staff in airport should be sacked for denying me boarding the kq staff at town office should be praised and rewarded for constructive and expedite provision of resolutions and quick ticket reissue by ignoring and avoiding the ota the rescheduled trip went fine in all aspects lounge access accommodated prior to all 4 flights and the lounges are all of good and solid quality slept fine in pride lounge in nairobi where i spent an eve and a night effective boardingsdeboardings by either bus on foot or by jetbridge onboard welcome champagne available on all four flights i had prebooked seat 1a which was given me throughout i preordered my favorite seafood meals which were delivered and tasty the sole exception was a morning flight where they could not manage my seafood despite it appeared in their flight manuscript not a big issue but they apologised kq always manage special meals effectively this is really a perk that not even legacy carriers like qatar airways or klm allows for the crews on all flights were fine professional caring and in good mood the food is getting better on these regional flights and i had my tasty hot minimeals served throughout hot towels provided nut mix were provided as snacks provided to assist on drinks which were served several times the challenge of my trip was the seemingly unusual turnaround in ebb to which airport staff were confused as i instantly returned to my origin without going landside they allowed me not to buy a transit visa and escorted me to transfer security and thereafter negotiated excessive spending time in lounge for me  i was granted full access for 7 hours though the airline agreement was only 3 hours onboard no ife and no wifi which is fine for short flights no luggagebaggage issues flying blue status respected and some skypriority entitlements were given eg priority boarding recommended will fly them again would have given 1010 but have to deduct a bit for denied boarding initially by the junior incompetent staff member in kigali airport
45,his review is regarding kenya airways customer service and has nothing to do with the details of a specific flight our return to chicago was cancelled when the ka pilots went on strike my family of four was left to arrange alternate flight arrangements by ourselves and our travel agent who was back in chicago we absolutely received no help from anyone at ka finally got economy class tickets with turkish air which we took from nairobi to istanbul and home to chicago had to pay for those tickets and was told to wait for a refund of the return with ka for our cancelled business class tickets as it turned out we had to wait a while for our refund which finally arrived on feb 27 the refund was issued for almost 1200 each 4800 for the four of us while this may sound fair please consider that we paid a total of 14647 for our four business class round trip tickets to nairobi and back additionally we had to pay for our return via turkish air at a total of 6356 so the refund represented less than 13rd of the cost of the original round trip tickets we were hoping for some consideration of the cost we incurred with turkish air which ultimately was caused by ka following a recommendation from the ceo of ka i was contacted by one of his subordinates while i do believe that this individual may have had some impact upon the processing of the refund i disagreed with him on numerous occasions when he and his staff tried to explain the refund policy to me following disruptions in service the following is a direct quote from his email to regarding these situations in the event of disruptions such as the strike the airline makes arrangements to carry you at the earliest opportunity on one of our scheduled services or reroute you to the destination shown on the ticket by our own services or those of another carrier at no additional cost to you should the alternative flights not be suitable or we are unable to rebook you to an alternate flight you are entitled to a refund of the value of the unused portion of your tickets i contended to him that neither myself nor any member of my family was approached by anyone from ka to reroute us or that anybody at the ka desk was willing to assist us make alternate flight arrangements i was particularly incensed when i read the words in red stating at no additional cost to you i feel lied to and disrespected by kenya airways in their addressing our significant and inconvenient disruption of service i have found examples of other travelers on our flight similarly affected by the strike who had desk clerks reroute them with no additional out of pocket expenditure the positive feelings i had about kenya airways prior to leaving africa have been replaced by a lack of trust a vow to never fly ka again and to pursue informing all travelers i can to be aware and leery of kas management of refunds and its ultimate care and respect for passengers
46,on the nairobi to addis ababa leg of my inbound flight from dubai to addis ababa on march 16 2023 our flight kq402 was supposed to depart at 1700 but finally after a very long and painful waiting we boarded the plane at 2300pm imagine arriving from dubai at 700am and waiting all day long and all night and add to this no cooperative staff and zero services to add insult to injury again they did it on the return flight apparently delayed flights are a norm in this airline our flight kq310 on 26 march was delayed by almost 2 hours similar things happened to me on my previous flights on this airline i wouldnt even rate them with a single star but there is no option with zero star
47,schedule for 1840  delayed still waiting at the boarding gates time now 2203 i asked them to arrange taxi from mombasa airport to mombasa town they refused worst airline even flew from heathrow on 20th upgraded the seat with 10000 when boarding the plane they given the seats two passengers at the same i had to seat in ordering seats stay away from kenya airways
48,had 3 hours delay at the airport in kenya and what was funny was to be told they cannot trace where the plane was but it was already in the country asking them that they need to send a message for my connection flight that there will a delay they advised that they will send and email upon arriving at or i was told there is nothing they can do and there was no email sent and they just need to book accommodation and in the morning i will have to come back to the office to meet their manager they could not assist and had to buy a new flight for the missed connection flight as they did not take responsibility knowing that i missed the connection flight because of their delays at the booked hotel were told that was a daily occurrence with kenya airways they have 10 or more people booked because to those delays they have less planes and need to use same plane when it lands
49,i am very disappointed about kenya airways no tea or coffee on any of 4 flights i had with them ended up with most humiliating customer service representative in nairobi airport she threatened not to let me on flight if i did not show her my eu settlement status and this is at the boarding gate after passport control my partner showed his passport and boarding pass to another representative and was let through with no questions some french people were told to go away and come back in 40 minutes as i was still standing there trying to get internet working and figuring out how to get my prove of eu settlement status which i dont need to fly to london anyway if i am eu citizen avoid this airline whenever possible
50,from harare it was delayed by two hours meaning we were suppose to miss our connecting flight in nairobi but was assured to get another flight upon arrival discovered the flight was cancelled we were put in hotels for the airport were we only slept for 130 mins there was chaos to get our passport back when we returned to the airport was rebooked for paris now with a 6 hour layover in paris previous had 2 hours for connecting flight when about to board the flight was delayed again by 1 hour
51,i flew kenya airways to travel to dubai for a conference on the 4th of december 2022 my luggage was delayed and as such was not available when i landed in dubai on the 5th december as such i needed to incur expenses to purchase clothing and undergarments in order to be able to attend the conference my luggage was returned to me on the 6th of december i submitted a claim for my expenses to customer care at kenya airways on 12 december i have yet to receive any assistance from the airline to date despite following up multiple times the only feedback that i have received is receipt of my email and advice that they have escalated my claim i will never travel kenya airways again and would not advise anyone to travel via this airline either
52,i had the most horrible flight experience with kenya airways and no compensation for delays and lost luggage my flight from jhb  lagos on thursday 1032023 was delayed for nearly 3 hours in johannesburg i missed my flight from nairobi to lagos because i had a flight to catch to berlin i jumped into accra flight and from from there paid for lagos flight in spite of the delay and trouble going through ghana and extra cost i wasnt prepared for on getting to lagos my baggageluggage is missing i needed my baggage to travel to berlin
53,paid for a flight at the airport to fly out shortly after only to be immediately put on standby because they overbooked the flight when asking for full refund they hold 5000 for 45 days and still not received and only offer of refund was with a no show fee deducted despite being at the airport when making the booking frankly unacceptable behaviour and no urgency to refund in full strongly advise to never book with this airline
54,boarding and seating was fine first flight was in what i would call premium economy whereas the second flight was in albeit tired in business class the food was not very much what i would call pride of africa standard but the attendants were very helpful i was very concerned when we were sprayed with a very noxious smelling substance  8 canisters held by two attendants without any prior warning or consultation the contents of these canisters was not revealed to me even though i asked i am on day 7 of feeling very ill with breathing trouble and eyesight and diarrhoea i attribute this to the 3 episodes of being sprayed  once on the first flight then again while stationery at victoria falls by crew with big spray containers and hand sprays as you would do in a field or should not do then again after departure from nairobi the food was mediocre to poor id hate to think what the economy class food was like if this was business class my seat in the first plane could not recline and the seat in the second one struggled to go up or down well i certainly would like to know what we were sprayed with and how we were not informed thereof
55,"
on time departure excellent in flight service on both sectors full meal and bar service including an excellent french champagne in all a great trip and an excellent start to my visit to zanzibar"
56,on jan 27th i flew from jfk via kenya airways with a layover in nairobi continued with a flight from nairobi to johannesburg final destination capetown in the interim i was not able to to retrieve my luggage in johannesburg apparently lost in transit spoke to a representative from kenya airways jum  who took all of my information  my number he kept me informed regarding the status of my luggage  before i boarded my flight to johannesburg he was able to locate my luggage  as promised it was there at my final destination i just wanted to thank him again for his service  diligence in helping to resolve my dilemma they need more people like him in public service
57,after booking my ticket i was very much afraid of all the negative reviews i have read but fortunately i had a pleasant flight both flights departure was on time luggage was received in good condition only thing that can be improved may be the food some extra items can be added
58,hey misplaced my bag i filled a form at heathrow airport and that was it i waited for days for calls nothing until i finally found their uk line and i called them and they kept telling me to hold on eventually they sent a bag but it was another persons bag i called that my should be brought and the other be returned i told them i wouldnt release the bag until my bag is sent and i am not comfortable with having someones property with me then i was told the true owner of the bag is in dubai and my bag is with them at nairobi and a picture of a wrapped bag i didnt wrap my bag was sent another 2 weeks and nothing has been done again customer service is totally rude this time kept complaining to them that all my clothes are in that bag and i have no winter cloth to wear here but they arent even ready to help
59,horrible first time experience travelled from london on 19th january to nairobi transiting to ghana before that they changed our departure time from nairobi to 30mins late as if that was not enough we got to nairobi at about 9pm after being delayed at heathrow only to be told our flight had been delayed again for another 6hours instead of leaving at 10pm we were to leave at 4am no communication and not even a rep to speak to another airport in nairobi which is their headquarters no body cared about us and all a lady could say it we will give you hot food such a horrible experience to just sit at the airport for 6hours after an 8and half hour flight with no place to freshen up and then instead of leaving at 4 we left at 450am no apologies from anyone now i am dreading my return journey i will not take this airline again and will certainly not recommend to any one shame to treat other africans as 2nd class citizens and yet call yourself the pride of africa maybe its time to change that name not befitting your poor services
60,Â Â i wanted to change my one flight time and was advised that i would be charged 2400usd 2400usd for a change that was more almost double of what it cost me to fly from usa and then to south africa i was only requesting a flight time change from kenya to south africa i tried to call customer services a few times and it takes almost an hour for them to answer after waiting an hour they cut me off all said i would never recommend this airline to anyone
61,highly do not recommend flight on the way to london had no working screens on my connecting flight to johannesburg they overbooked our flight by 70 passengers no order or sympathy whatsoever and it was a dog fight to get the first available seat which was 8 hours later  will never fly with them again
62,we were travelling from amsterdam to johannesburg with kenia airways our original itinerary was as follows amsterdam to paris kq1243 05012023 1635  1750 paris to nairobi kq115 05012023 2020  0625 nairobi to johannesburg kq760 06012023 0745  1055 when boarding in paris we were made to sit in the aeroplane for 45 hours without air conditioner food or drink we eventually left and arrived too late for our connecting flight to johannesburg kenia airways wasnt prepared at all for this eventuality even though they knew about it for more than 12 hours we were bundled into a group and they tried sorting out the passengers rerouted flight this took kenia airways 4 hours to complete for us some passengers were still waiting after us our itinerary changed to nairobi to dar es salaam kq488 06012023 2345  0115 dar es salaam to johannesburg 4z37 07012023 0325  0610 on arrival at johannesburg we realized that our luggage wasnt on the carousel even after i did confirm with kenia airways 4 times that the luggage would be rerouted with our itinerary change once when we received our changed flight details second time just before we were taken to the hotel to freshen up third time on my return from the hotel and then the last time when boarding the flight to dar es salaam i was reassured that our luggage would be on the flight with us each time now getting to realize that the above was all lies just to get rid of me we started the process to find our luggage after being sent to 3 different counters we were directed to the airlink customer service centre here we met our angel who checked and assured us that the luggage never arrived in dar es salaam which means that airlink didnt receive it from kenia airways this meant it wasnt airlinks responsibility anymore but they then told us that they will load an enquiry and get the process going upon loading he realized that the luggage was still in nairobi but was scheduled to be on flight kq760 on 712023 this meant that kenya airways didnt change the luggage tags to include our flights the problem was that now we were already on the landside of the airport and couldnt go back to the airside to get our luggage on the carousel after the flight land at 1055
63,on 29112022 i tried to make a booking online for a ticket costing 930 usd for a relative however the kenya airways website showed error after the payment and the ticket was not issued i bought the same ticket the same day from another bank account on 30112022 i contacted the ka customer service to cancel the booking in process for the 1st ticket the agent promised to do that instead he issued the ticket he apologized and promised i would receive refund within 5 days instead the 5th day the money was taken from my account it was in authorisation status until i placed a refund claim online which was acknowledged by ka and i was promised to be paid within 15 working days which did not happen i tried to communicate with ka however i either received no response or very general responses i dont see any good will from ka to reimburse the money which was taken from my account because of the fault of their agent their whatsapp customer service is a joke if you manage to speak to actual person the minute you mention refund they cut you off dont fly with this airline i really regret giving ka a 2nd chance
64,i booked my business class seat with kenyan airways on thursday the 3rd of november for sunday the 6th i had a ba flight booked for the 7th but needed to be home early at no time at booking was any issues indicated i had to fly to nairobi the day before and stay in the crowne plaza near the airport for the night at 630 am i arrived at the terminal to find utter chaos it transpires the pilots had gone on strike a day or so previously at no point was there any communication to tell passengers this we were pushed from pillar to post around the airport and then told to stand in line to rebook there were still people waiting from the previous day to get alternative flights fortunately im in the position to be able to afford to find an alternative so got a business seat from nairobi to dubai on emirates and then a 6 hour layover and then onto heathrow again with emirates its now been over a month and despite putting in my claim im still waiting for my 2600 one way ticket to be refunded ive given them the benefit of the doubt for a month and absolutely nothing hence my review they clearly are going to hang onto my money for as long as possible and ignore me im going back to kenya soon and have stuck with ba i would never trust kenyan airways again
65,first time in kenya airways and all was good they had an email upgrade offer to either business class or to have the seat next to you vacant i chose the latter as it was only 45 and an hour ten flight check in was friendly and easy zanzibar airport has a new terminal but there is literally one restaurant and one shop nothing else so was stuck with all my taz currency as there was nothing to buy boarding was quick fa greeting at the door had my seat next to me open as promised so lots of space smooth take off and drink and snack service for the flight no inflight entertainment but for a short flight who cares landed early and bags off once we were thru immigration great flight
66,we booked our tickets to zanzibar on 10 july 22 already we chose a direct flight route and paid the premium for that choice 8 hours before our departure kenya airways sends a message to say that our connection flight to zanzibar has been delayed on further investigation we found that kenya air has now charged us the expensive direct route but placed us on the delayed cheap route just prior to departure we are losing a fully paid day at our hotel in zanzibar and have to sit on nairobi airport from 07h20 to 19h50 great way to start our honeymoon we have been trying to resolve this issue for 3 hours but they do not even bother to communicate to their passengers this airline is a total scam
67,i had a canceled flight from kigali to nairobi and filed all proper procedures for refund since august 5 2022 since then ive had several back and forth to their office and until today november 14 they have not issued my refund every time i talk to them its the same false promises this airline has no accountability especially when dealing with foreigners once they have your money in their country its gone id not recommend anyone to trust these thieves
68,i was connecting from lusaka to new york from kenya i got off the plane i checked the board it said gate 16 for jfk new york so i sat there waiting for the boarding call  the flight for new york was supposed to departure at 1135 i sat there for almost an hour with no boarding call i asked one of the employees there what time the flight for new york was leaving she gave a vague answer than around 1140 or so they was a last boarding call the gate was charged to gate 19 i almost missed my flight and than i had to run to the gate i had a very bad experience and i dont think i will fly kenya airways again very disappointed
69,he flight service started well with staff being warm and interactive aisha warmly smiled and engaged the people around me she has great customer service and deserved a recognition i was having red wine and when she did not have any when i asked for it once she found the wine she brought it for me and warmly said that i found your preference the food was not so great and the flight felt congested however the service compensated for some not so good things hopefully this message of appreciation will reach her aisha and her colleague dams to be honest as well that kenya airways is probably the only airline that offers one of the best luggage allowance making it a top choice while travelling home
70,we have just flown into nairobi from harare and going on to amsterdam and heathrow things started badly  the flight was delayed for an hour and a half no explanation or apology offered on board we then noticed there was no in flight entertainment on offer neither of us had flown long distance before on a plane without in flight entertainment there were no blankets on offer either it can get pretty cool on these flights the food was a joke something like a mini pasty with quite a nasty taste and possibly even worse a savoury muffin were only half way through this flight in nairobi were now waiting for 8 hours overnight the restaurant were in is quite possibly the saddest looking place ive ever drunk a coffee in unloved doesnt begin to describe it anyway were wondering now can this possibly get any worse there are certain words which are applicable here but this will not be published if i include them but im sure you can guess what they are whats really alarming is looking back at reviews from 11years ago making exactly the same criticisms
71,he cabin crew were very rude food was  almost thrown at us when i asked for beverage she said she didnt have and no alternative was offered until i peeped and saw what i asked the crew was not courteous at all
72,due to flight delay i have to stay airport long time firstly in antananarivo to nairobi there was 1h flight delay real time was 7pm and in nairobi they said flight will fly at 8pm but again it delayed  it fly after 11pm this is a worst experience that i had in my life because of his i have to stay on bench 24h without food and sleep
73,paid a fortune to return to kenya on short notice i have used kq many times and always flown business not used them for a few years now due to covid and using other airlines check in at heathrow and boarding the plane was a shambles stood in a business class line but no one checking in business class passengers  despite being told by ground staff this was the correct lane eventually we were spotted and check became proactive after 20 minutes similar issue trying to get on the plane kq is let down by the ground handling at heathrow once on board the service is excellent with attentive staff and i like the boeing 787 quality of the beverages is good and has clearly improved the quality of the food is poor and not what would get on swiss etc in contrast on the return journey at nairobi excellent and quick check in security and lounge has improved form when used in the past food on the return leg just as bad as on the way out once again the staff were excellent and attentive and very helpful entertainment pretty poor and lacking in choice
74,his was my first flight on kenya airways i was impressed with the service cleanliness and punctuality at the airport as well as on flight i would highly recommend the airline as a customer friendly choice
75,i recently had a trip to dubai on the 10th of july 2022 it was a linking flight from cameroon passing through bangui to nairobi kenya then to dubai honestly speaking its my worst experience so far its been almost two weeks since i arrived dubai but am yet to receive my luggage before leaving the airport on arrival i placed a complain with dnata baggage services regarding my baggage and i was assured that i would get my luggage in less than 48 hours which have turn into two weeks have finished every penny i had on me for mobile top up and when i even call no 1 picks no get back to me have sent emails and gotten no reply maybe next time you inform customers in advance that their luggage arent safe or secured so they would know what to do with their luggage would never recommend this airline to anyone unless they wish to have a similar experience what a waste of my money
76,kq257 from antananarivo getting late for more than an hour causing passengers missing connections at their own costs with bad customer care and in addition poor bag management passengers losing bags with bad tagging we had to spend more than 2 hours waiting for baggage tracking incompetent staff on duty with no respect towards passengers everything today was pathetic
77,i highly recommend kenya airways their services are excellent especially their cabin crew very efficient my trip to and from bujumbura to johannesburg was very smooth
78,i have never seen such an illfunctioning airline the airline people took 1 hour to check my documentation and after issuing my boarding pass they informed that the flight is delayed by 3 hours which left me no choice but to stay at the airport for more than 5 hours the airline was least bothered with the inconvenience and didnt do anything to compensate this i will strongly suggest never fly with them
79,i have never flown on such an inconsiderate airline i am appalled by the service the flight from paris to nairobi was delayed which meant i missed my connecting flights to johannesburg then to cape town this did not seem to worry them and they said it would be at my expense to rebook another flight to cape town this is the fourth time ive flown nairobi airways and all four times they were late and caused subsequent missing of flights this airline should be shut down they treat people with absolute disrespect
80,his is the worst airline i have ever flown we booked roundtrip direct flights to mauritius to and from nairobi for our honeymoon we planned to spend 7 days in mauritius the night before our flight from nairobi to mauritius i was emailed yes emailed at 1119pm while i was sleeping to inform me that our flight time was to be changed from 100pm to 730am as i was understandably sleeping at the time i did not review this message until i woke up at 530am that morning i was staying in naivasha kenya at the time and so did not have time to make it to the airport we immediately called due to the fact that we were going to miss our flight and no one was able to explain to us why this change was made so last minute to the flight schedule and why we were not informed ahead of time i would think it would be common sense that an email in the middle of the night 8 hours prior to the new proposed flight time for a now 730am flight is insufficient notice even after speaking to multiple different kenya airways employees i was never given a reason for the flight time change just operations ultimately we were rebooked for a flight late that day but this was an indirect flight through dubai which didnt leave until 510pm and involved 16 hours of travel instead of what was supposed to be a 4 hour and 20 minute flight because of this we were unable to check in for our hotel that we had paid for the night of our arrival and instead arrived the next morning exhausted having been traveling all night and transferring in dubai in the middle of the night to boot the behaviour of the passengers on the plane from nairobi to dubai was absurd people were constantly standing up on the plane and blocking the aisle even after being asked to sit down by flight attendants kids were running around unrestrained and flight attendants had to ask over the intercom for parents to restrain their children multiple times in the row in front of me someone was watching a movie on a tablet with nonstop gunfire with the volume on max and he was not using headphones to top it all off in addition to missing our first night of the trip kenya airways also changed our return flight time moving it up from 710pm to 140pm this effectively compromised two different days of our trip as we were unable to do much the morning of our departure and were unable to take advantage of the late checkout that we were qualified for at our hotel on top of it all our return flight was ultimately delayed by 40 minutes and the process to check in our bags took an absurdly long time longer than it has ever taken for any other flight i have been on we had all of our documents and it still took us 10 minutes to complete the check in process and this was after standing in line for one hour waiting for the check in desk bottom line if you can avoid it do not fly on kenya airways you will absolutely regret it we contacted customer service multiple times and they have absolutely refused to make amends or compensate us in any way for destroying our honeymoon
81,worst airline i have ever flown customer service is the worst their agent are rude and mean not helpful at all do not fly this airline especially via nairobi food is terrible seats are nearly broken in the aircraft
82,flying from lusaka to london via nairobi last month with kenya airways was a shocking experience predeparture tests are no longer needed upon arrival to england however my instinct told me to check if i needed a pcr to transit through kenya the covid information on the kenya airways website is extremely misleading when i filled in all the details about my trip it said nothing about a pcr test however when i spoke to an agent on whatsapp they said i need a pcr test as i am not vaccinated screenshots attached having to rush around lusaka the day before i flew to london i eventually got a pcr test i arrived at lusaka airport at 2330 on sunday and did not get my bags checked in until 0110 on monday 5 minutes before baggage drop off closes due to the airline and staffs poor customs i knew my bags were overweight and decided to pay the additional cost rather than repack i was told that i cannot pay using card and can only pay in kwacha or us dollar i had 100 which was roughly the additional cost and it took over 45 minutes for the staff to find out whether i could pay using british pounds and inform me the atm i was advised to go to outside on the bottom floor of the airport was out of service and i had to run to the domestic airport 10 minutes from the international airport if youre in shape to withdraw cash from the second nearest atm the total amount was 2066 kwacha and when i presented 2100 kwacha i was told they did not have any change if you are travelling to southern africa ethiopian airlines is a much better airline and i can see why more people prefer them over kenya airways
83,checked in online the evening before the flight aircraft depicted was a 737800 i selected and paid for an exit row seat a couple of hours later i received a text message saying that the flight was going to be delayed from 0745 to 1120 for the usual operational reasons on arrival at the airport the next morning for the delayed departure i was issued with a boarding pass that still showed my original seat number of 19a as it turned out the airline had changed the aircraft to an embraer 190 which i discovered when we were boarding so while i had the same seat number from the original 737 it was not in an exit row on the e190 no apology no information at check in boarding was chaotic as usual they called for business class and priority passengers to board first i have siver elite status only for everybody to end up on a bus that waited until it was full before proceeding to the airplane so much for priority boarding even with the delayed departure time the flight was delayed even further departing at 1220 kq is a disgrace unfortunately they are currently the only airline serving the nairobijohannesburg route and are milking this for all its worth with shoddy service pride of africa not by a long shot
84,monrovia to kigali through accra and nairobi 1920 may 2022 the 2 aircrafts were both b737800s in very good condition i had to change my departure dates and it took me only 10 minutes online  and was even free as it was a business light ticket all flights were on time checked in online monrovia airport is full of hustlers pretending to be from the airline but want tips and they are annoying the airline should chase them away kenya airways kq uses a third party lounge in monrovia which is small but good with courteous proactive attendants no champagne but plenty of drinks and liquor the local club beer is good embarking easy fast not a single crosscheck from lounge to seat  what a pleasure onboard welcome drinks were served the seats were huge and well bolstered reclining new and very comfortable could sleep ife or wifi was only working on the last leg no printed menus were given out but the fas asked each individual on food choices my preordered special sea food meals were all different delicious and served without reminders business class was full after accra but i did neither feel cramped nor stuffy fas all kenyans were good and caring  though maybe not world class in nbo the pride lounge did the job for me during the 12 hours layover the last stretch to kigali was with ife onboard champagne and my beloved seafood hot meal which kq still offers even in economy in contrast to qatar and emirates who have stopped this service at is it not qualifying as dietary reasons to order luggage delivered quickly and in good order good value for money  will fly with them again
85,it was a bad experience i had a flight from entebbe to nairobi and from nairobi to amsterdam i missed the first one and went straight to nairobi seemed that they canceled the whole flight i had to go to sales and they without explaining any detail told me i had to pay 475 dollars for a new flight as i had no time at all i had to make a quick decision but after i tried to ask for answers but i did not get any good explanation beside that i had to pay the difference bad customer service and lousy way to dealing with people
86,flew kigali to monrovia over nairobi and accra on 89 may 2022 flights on time checked in online worked well and got my bps in airport swiftly no luggage issues recognised as skyteam elite kenya airways staff came to me in lounge and without request carried my handluggage for me from lounge to the aircraft no waiting time nor queues anywhere on the trip despite the flights were full or almost full kq delivers and have rarely let me down over the years pearl lounge in kigali delivers but suffers from deprived views of airport runways first flight was on an embraer 190 which is a lovely roomy aircraft onboard they allowed me to shift to an exit row as my original seat was mistakenly occupied by another person the seat now offered was very nice  it would have cost me 50 usd if booked online drinks were generously provided appreciate kenya airways often have the happy hour concept where a request for a single drink most often triggers serving two the wine in minibottles was acceptable a south african stonedale i had requested seafood meal and i got it it was a cold tasty salmon sandwich fas were kind and effective no ife nor wifi but on a 90 minutes flight its not an issue transit in nairobi airport smooth and quick it took me only 15 minutes to reach the kq pride lounge i love this lounge roomy and curvy designs with lots of nice sections had a god nights sleep after acquainting myself with a niederburg rosewine which superseded an alternative italian sparkling wine the next flights from nairobi to monrovia via accra were on their b737800 despite the flight was completely full all seats taken in both classes the staff manage to care passengers well no power outlet nor monitors only wifi and use of personal devices were possible special meal rendered to perfection i also tried other dishes as i was offered drinks provided generously again happy hour order 1 get 2 occurred at least once slight delay as the stopover in accra took longer time as a lot of passengers disembarked before cleaning and loads of new passengers came on board  again the flight was full luggage in monrovia came out quickly nicely done kenya airways can recommend
87,addis ababa to mumbai via nairobi both the mentioned flights delayed in their boarding moving and landing the second journey took 8 hours instead of 65 hours overall very poor time management we cant rely on this airline and book domestic flights the worst is i booked my return ticket also with this airline it was on 27th april 225 am from mumbai based on this i had booked a domestic flight from chennai to mumbai 6pm 26th april 2022 i had taken the rtpcr test for flying 6pm web checkin was supposed to be done for kenya airways 4pm i received a message that the flight is rescheduled the rescheduling was done inappropriately the flight kq203225am  27th april was rescheduled to 27th april 725 am the connecting flight kq400 27th april 830am was rescheduled to 29th april 5pm what do i do in nairobi for 25 days i had booked through goibibo i could not connect with any human being in gooibibo to arrange for alternate ways so i had to cancel my domestic flight to mumbai i cancelled all the kenya bookings and flew through flydubai with new cost still now the refund has not been given by kenya airways or goibibo i lost 4000 inr out of 5100 inr for the domestic flight due to lastminute cancellation the rtpcr test taken went to waste
88,he female air hostesses were so rude and cold to me i sat by the window seat and the two other passengers on the row were fast asleep so i rang the bell multiple times no response i made verbal requests twice as they walked past and even though they gave a cold response saying they would get me a cup of water  nothing kenya airways you are not the pride of africa and i am extremely unimpressed with your work ethics
89,terrible experience with luggage had an amount allocated on my ticket staff would not allow it said it was over very rude and unhelpful staff when checking in my luggage told to re pack my case not terribly friendly cabin staff half full plane on my journey would not allow passengers to use empty seats ridiculous and a first on a flight for me i have previously been able to use unoccupied seats massive amount of single use plastic on this flight shocking really nice food hopefully never have to fly with the pride of africa again
90,ble company in terms of customer services kq lots my luggage for the second time in a year  this time bags were not loaded in lilongwe  and the whole process to get them was just so bad and kq staff not helpful at all at the airport no customer care at all it took ages more than two hours to enter everyones declaration in the system then kq said we would get our bags within 24 hours which did not happen  it took more than 48 hours to get them we are supposed to be able to get a refund when the time exceeds 24 hours and guess what to do so you have to go to the airport it is not possible to get that online  in nairobi the airport is 1h away from the city center just a way for people to not get it sorry kq you are not the pride of africa at all
91,phoned to change my flight and was told that it has been done two days later and having not received an email confirmation i phoned back and they said that the agent i spoke to did not book and i would need to pay 89 dollars as the rates have gone up pushed to fly on a different date and still there would be a 60 dollar penalty attached had the agent booked me in the first time i phoned i would not be incurring these costs it took me two days of spending at least 4 hours on the phone to their international number where they are cautious not to phone you back as it will cost them and will happily put you on hold for as long as they want first day i spoke to an agent who said that they would book me into the flight but refer me to the manager to take off incurred costs next referred to the supervisor who swore to sort this out asap waited till end of the day and phoned back and she was about to leave the office but said she has handed over to the next shift manager nothing happened phoned again the following morning and got hold of an agent who also promised to phone me back within an hour after three hours of waiting i phoned her back and she put me on hold to go speak to her manager and came back and said that they have reached a decision that i need to pay bear in mind that i have had to move this flight twice due to their incompetence as much as i am kenyan and would like to promote a local airline do not use these guys and it needs to be made public as they are awful and do not care at all
92,kenya airways reservations staff are very incompetent i booked a flight to nairobi with departing time 1520pm only to be rescheduled to a 4 hours later flight at 1930 and that without notification i booked the earlier flight because i was connecting later that evening to a lufthansa flight to frankfurt due to this reschedule i almost missed my flight to frankfurt it only needed friendly lufthansa staff to open up the gate for me kenya airways staff simply assume that all passengers flying from kisumu have nairobi as their final destination they dont even think that some might have connection to other countries i will never fly them again and never recommend them to anyone they caused me a lot of stress without compensation
93,he most horrible customer experience i have ever had with an airline i have ended up being charged triple the original price i paid despite the fact that i called the customer contact center day before flight issued with last minute information to rebook my flight 15 hours before the flight i dont think i have anything nice to say about my experience dont think i can recommend the airline to another airport staff very unhelpful and dismissive and dont think i will ever consider to use the airline ever again
94,its hard for me to write a review because i am not sure if the airline always cancels flights or if it is just problematic to leave from sudan my flight was suddenly canceled twice one of the times it was canceled was right before departure after i already took and paid for my covid test it was incredibly stressful i wrote to an assistant on whatsapp who told me it was a computer error and that my flight will still go and that i should just go to the airport but i felt it was not this way  i called thankfully someone helped me and put me on a flight with ethiopian airlines and i flew with them via ethiopia so in the end i never flew with kenya airways it was an incredibly stressful experience and dealing with people over the phone was impossible in the end the woman i spoke to was the only helpful person  and putting me on a new flight with another airline helped a lot from what i read they cancel often if it wasnt for this woman at the end i would give them a very low rating
95,arrived at the jkia an hour before the flight 3 tickets and had excess weight of 3kgs with an option of 6pcs of luggage but had 5 the lady insisted we pay or repack and stated we had no time tried to talk to her even her colleague but she refused saying you should have come earlier any way we did re pack she insisted we print the pcr test result and i told her we do it digital due to the current covid situation and also we are residents at our destination and had a system in place for that but still insisted we print and time was not on our side it took me 20 min to do so and when i was back she told me i was late and the gate was already closed some efforts were made and we made it to the flight which was empty upon arrival in dubai no luggage the tickets i had were for 90kgs x3270 but for sure i had less than the 270kgs with an excess of 3kgs in one pc and no time almost missed my flight no leniency or situational exceptions felt really disappointed and couldnt mind the hassle if there was time  i am not giving up on kq staff pls try to accommodate based on situations
96,we boarded kenya airways to seychelles at 345am from dar es salaam to catch our flight to the seychelles at 815am we reached nairobi to find out that our flight has been delayed to 2pm without any notification when we argued about the 8 hour plus delay they offered us a croissant and tea after spending 8 hours they further delayed the flight to 4pm without any notification when argued again they called the manager and the manager didnt do anything except tell us its a technical issue the truth was that they didnt have enough passengers so they decided to cancel the flight
97,i have paid a flight from zambia to mauritius with kenya airways all in one there was no direct flights and have transit flight my flights were  02 dec  zambia to harare to kenya kq706 03 dec  kenya to mauritius kq270 however on the 3rd december the kenya crew did not let me take the 2nd flight from kenya to mauritius as per her she got a message telling me people who has been in red list countries within the 14 days cannot travel to mauritius how come this kenya airways crew could let me take the flight from zambia to harare to kenya but did not let me take the flight from kenya to mauritius and my final destination of this flight was mauritius this is unacceptable also i have paid for this service and the staff at the boarding gate 16 on 3rd december at 11am was not polite and not helping at all and did not talk to me properly
98,wonderful service onboard this early morning flight to lusaka really enjoyed spending time in the new pride lounge which is in another league in terms of ambience compared to the simba lounge  although i imagine the former could get quite busy and appreciated the hassle free checkin and immigration process although the covid test check outside in the booth is quite strange the only negative was the chaotic boarding processes with no premier world priority and a free for all to get final verification checks completed once onboard treated to fabulous service from the purser who just couldnt do enough  from offering both business class breakfast options due to a quiet premier world cabin the warm fresh croissants and coffee were highlights i bid to upgrade the ticket which cost 210 but it was really worth the splurge to arrive well refreshed for a day at work well done kq
99,hugely enjoyed this trip with kq wonderful to see kq finally reinstate a full meal service on this route  i spoke to the purser who confirmed so many customers were on connecting flights that the company opted to stop the pathetic small pie  although im told on the early morning flight it is still a cold croissant and tiny piece of fruit however on this leg a very impressive three hot meal options wee offered  i was the last seat on the last row at the back and they still had all 3 options available  and the traditional east african beef pilau was absolutely delicious cabin crew wonderfully interactive  and as always  cannot give you enough drinks  two bottles of wine and two lagers each time one disappointment was the refusal of lusaka kq agents to allow me to use my flying blue miles to upgrade at the airport despite being assured by kq hq that it is was totally possible i was told i would only get a bar service as they dont cater for additional unknown business class passengers but my return trip just didnt bear this out i dont think they wanted the hassle of a little extra work to be honest keep it up kq your flights are expensive for the flight duration but customers also opt for convenience and service and you have this handsdown
100,i had an issue with my covid test did it too early so it would have expired by the time i got to ghana the whole situation was such a mess i was certain that i would not be able to fly lydia advised me that there was a quick testing station outside which obviously required me to pay an arm and a leg because these covid test fees are a scam i digress she waited for me until the last minute to get my results so she could get my bag checkedin when i was running between the testing station and the checkin counter she decided that i could leave my bag there i was literally the only remaining customer so she was just being kind and took my number so i could run downstairs to go check on my results and she could call me once it was absolutely necessary for them to close the counter she did call me and while i was running a few minutes late she spoke to her superiors who agreed that the time was negligible and i could therefore run back upstairs with my results while she waited to quickly send my bag through lydia was probably the most helpful airport person id ever met while some of her colleagues were annoyed with my situation and essentially had given up on me she endeavoured to help me well beyond her call of duty this is the kind of south africa i know  one filled with ubuntu while acting within the confines of professional conduct lydia didnt break any rules or try to cut be some slack because that would have been unethical and against her professional conduct she was both kind and professional we need more lydias at the airport
101,i never thought i would experience the worst customer care from an airline which boast itself as the pride of africa trouble started during covid19 test verification at the check in desk my family of six 2 adults and 4 kids were supposed to travel to jfk via london on 24821 three of my kids had negative test results while the rest of us had turned positive earlier in the month but had been cleared by a health official to end the mandatory isolation on 13821 as required by cdc in order to travel to the us a passenger needs to have either a negative test result or proof of recovery positive test certificate and a discharge letter from a health official if they were covid positive within the last 90 days we presented our fully compliant documents to the check in clerk but instead of taking their time to confirm that indeed those were the documents that were required at our final destination she automatically rejected them and said we all had to have negative test results otherwise we would have to go back and wait until we all tested negative they didnt have any reference sheet or document to base their decision on the only reference was to pretend that they had called an office who deals with this sort of thing to confirm then enter a supervisor  who didnt even take time to understand what the problem was and said without a care in the world right to our faces oh we deal with this sort of thing every single day we send people home  they never realized the agony we were going through never at any point did they produced any document to support their decision in fact at one point the supervisor  disappeared to go retrieve an internal document that supposedly has the latest updates but returned 10 minutes later empty handed they absolutely had no clue about what they were saying and could not even take a moment to check the requirements for our country of destination and the cdc website what a total customer care failure and a huge embarrassment to the company to say we were deeply disappointed is an understatement it is a fact once one has tested covid positive it is not advisable to retest until after at least 90 days because chances are high that they can still test positive even though they are not contagious this fact doesnt seem to make sense to kq check in clerks or at least the two i was dealing with the whole experience caused a lot of emotional distress especially to my kids not to mention financial loss and delay to get back to work
102,its our first time booking an all round trip with kenya airways our journey to nairobi and johannesburg was outstanding we thought that was all until we experienced a hospitality at its very best when we were returning from johannesburg to nairobi and nairobi to lagos kudos to the pilots in kq766 very professional in dealings with turbulent as a flight simulator gamer i could feel the way the plane was calmed we connected to kq532 to lagos at past 8am on the 12th of june the hospitality gestures given by the air hostesses was superb and second to none it is very usual for air hostesses to see and treat you as guests but its unusual to see them treat to as family we felt welcomed like home away from home bevlyne one of the hostesses in kq532 very friendly calm jovial and quick to response to passengers request these trips is unforgettable and forever worthwhile will love to travel via kenya airways again and again truly its the pride of africa
103,i think the worst airline i have ever travelled do not use them unless you have to business class is the worst i have flown  uncomfortable seats poor quality food and the worst entertainment i have seen on an airline to cap it all they have lost my baggage which is where they unravel even further with customer service that is completely nonexistent they dont answer the phone dont respond to emails and their online chat means waiting for 30 minutes and then realising that they actually have no one there at any time of day its a novel way of taking responsibility for their failings  just dont answer i cannot understand how sky team can associate with this airline i will not fly with them again and nor will anyone in my business
104,business passengers went on last because the economy passengers would have walked past two business rows this was obviously for covid19 reasons but given that every passenger had had a negative pcr test it seemed a little pointless there was a noticeable degree of irritation among those who had been made to wait until last especially as it is branded sky priority the seats seemed slightly worn and although the dimmable windows are a nice touch in the 787 they are not as effective as pulldown blinds we were offered soft drinks before takeoff but they produced a glass of champagne when i asked breakfast was served before the lights went out for the main meal the choice was beef chicken or vegetarian the cabin crew were polite and efficient although with so much protective equipment it felt more like being in an operating theatre rather than a plane the food seemed bland and uninspiring there were no major issues with this flight but if kenya airways wants to attract premium passengers postcovid it needs to offer a better and more memorable service
105,his was not my first time flying business with kenya airways but it was definitely not the best the plaza lounge at lhr was not serving alcohol on the basis that the food was not substantial boarding was chaotic  although there was a business line everyone was using it after eventually getting on the aircraft and after a long wait i was offered a small glass of champagne seating was oldstyle parallel pair business was about half full and there were signs of ageing it then took an inordinate amount of time for the meal to be served  choice was meat or chicken it was probably the first time ever that the starter and main course were both rice the flight was uneventful and although not fully flatbed i did manage to sleep no bottle of water was provided breakfast was a small dry croissant yogurt and a small bowl of fruit i know airlines are struggling but given how much i paid for the ticket to have a service which was not as good as premium economy on some other airlines was frustrating if kenya airways wants to compete with its rivals it needs to stop pennypinching and offer its business customers a level of service which justifies what they have paid
106,entebbe to johannesburg via nairobi the crew was very hospitable and polite good time management as well however the crew responsible for announcements should stop eating the words and try to be more audible
107,horrible they canceled our flight 3 days before it was meant to happen they told us we could fly only 2 weeks later which was impossible for us as a result we had to spend over 1000 usd to get to our destination when we asked for compensation they offered us a 150 usd travel voucher even if we told them that we wont be able to travel in the next two years they refused to convert it to a compensation refund really bad service never again we dont recommend this airline at all
108,i am more than disappointed with kenya airways which not only misplaced my luggage but has till this moment not been able to give me any response despite the numerous attempts i made either in writing to their headquarter or personally visiting their dubai airport terminal 1 office since august 18th 2020 that i arrived dubai till date given this present circumstance i doubt if i can recommend this airlines to someone else if nothing is done to prevent such occurrences in future because im not an isolated example
109,extremely unsatisfied customers we have been trying to rebook our flights to kenya for the last 6 months with only one response which was on christmas eve of 2020 and we havent heard anything from them ever since we have a booked and paid for trip which we had to rebook due to covid19 in 2020 our trip is expected to be this april 2021 and we had supposedly received our cancelled flights in the form of a refunded voucher which was never ever received from the airline we then received on christmas eve a link to our supposedly new flights which had a time frame to a payment portal from 15h0017h3018h00 roughly let me reiterate on christmas eve who is checking their emails to rebook flights in such a short time frame we then tried to access the portal that night at 19h00 and we could not access it to pay an additional fee when this was supposed to be fully refunded i might add for our flights in april i have sent roughly 50 emails to the airline and that doesnt include my partners emails to kenya airways we have heard nothing back from them and they have about r35 000 of our money in promised refunded tickets which we do not have and cannot get hold of anybody from kenya airways this is beyond unprofessional and i have literally tried to contact anyeveryone i possibly could from kenya airway
110,flight kq101 to johannesburg via nairobi was meant to depart lhr on 8th february flight was at the gate but boarding time kept getting delayed and delayed and was eventually canceled then complete chaos ensued kenya airways do not have a desk at lhr tried to call 020 8283 1818 several times on the 82 and 92 but no answer and then line was disconnected was directed to hotel at lhr and then told flight was going to leave turned out it wasnt so was directed back to hotel at no point as there any customer service offered to customers kenya airways made no attempt to rebook me on another flight or contact me at all so had to purchase an alternative flight with saa at considerable cost as i needed to leave that night have not been able to get any compensation at all for cancellation alternative flight no apology at all is it any wonder that no one wants to travel anymore when airlinestour operators treat customers so appalling you deserve to all go under
111,i booked tickets to travel and had to make changes to the ticket i contacted them via numerous emails and no response their website says a change in ticket can be made at a cost even during this pandemic and for a first time change i reached out to them explaining i am unable to pay for the penalty they refused to respond rather they informed their back office team to increase the price of the tickets and then they responded quoting amounts triple to what the website says i explained to them and they refused to do anything about it i checked back on their website a week later and they had dropped the price of change of the ticket to double rather than triple i contacted them as they intentionally removed the option to change my ticket online they said they had sent a payment link  well payment link that says i pay triple when your website currently says its a double payment i requested they send a new payment link of course they refused a few hours later they informed their back office team to triple the price of change of ticket again avoid this airline by all means
112,after cancelling two of my flights kq offered me options and i chose to travel klm from amsterdam to nairobi to wait for my flight from nairobi to abidjan thought my original journey was all kq flights and i paid for 4 bags from amsterdam to abidjan the second leg of my journey only had 2 bags covered in my baggage allowance in other words kq basically robbed me as i had to leave 2 of my bags behind now i have to find a way to get my bags to my final destination which is undoubtedly going to cost even more than paying for 2 bags did i am extremely disappointed in the services that were provided i am moving for kq to refund me the money for my bags seeing as i paid for a service i was not provided
113,i have taken kenya airways a number of times and it is quite disappointing that instead of improving the service continues to get worse the food served remains almost inedible and inflight entertainment is virtually nonexistent due to covid they cancelled my tickets unfortunately proved to be a horrendous experience as customer service is virtually nonexistent the airline doesnt respond to emails and the telephones indicated on their website does not get picked it did not help that one is left with no option since they closed their offices this airline needs to be more responsive to its customers it seems to want to be known literally to go with the notion of polepole or slowly if it is to get itself out of its reported financial woes due to plunging customer numbers
114,we flew from jfk to nbo just before the pandemic was declared this was the first leg of a journey to seychelles sez we found the cabin crew on this flight to be excellent attentive and really friendly it seemed that the cabin staff were up and down the aisles very frequently and had a smile on their faces something that must be tough during these times we told them how pleased we were at the end of the flight and they seemed genuinely surprised to get the positive feedback we passed this on to the airline via their website but have received no response as yet check in at jfk was easy but probably atypical due to the reduced number of flyers in early march this year the same could be said for the boarding process the plane itself was new a lovely 787 with mood lighting and big windows the legroom was reasonable not cramped but not luxurious overall it was comfortable for such a long journey the food on the outbound journey was really good way better than we expected and our son childs meal was also better than typical kids meals the biggest negative on our outbound journey was the entertainment system there were very few recent movies and the choice was extremely limited take your tablet or phone and download some ebooks movies or other entertainment to it if you are expecting to use the system on the plane to keep you occupied for 14 hours you will be disappointed if i was rating the airline based on this flight i would actually give this flight 4 or even 5 stars as it was enjoyable but external factors are influencing that rating our return journey from seychelles was delayed overnight by 14 hours and we had to fight to get accommodation due to this delay and the kenyan government ban on entry for foreigners due to covid19 it also meant our mini kq safari booked through the airline had to be cancelled this is all very understandable and we have no issue with any of that we cancelled this over email with the safari division while in the seychelles and assumed there would be no issue however despite meeting 3 of the criteria needed for refund i am now going through a visa chargeback process to recover this fee first they say to talk to travel agent when we booked the safari directly through them on a different credit card number and then they say its valid for a year and they do not refund services  despite having a clear statement on their website that a refund can be done if you fit 1 of the 3 criteria  1 contact the email provided within 24 hours of the safari to cancel we did it 6 days before 2 have a flight cancellation or delay we were cancelled and put on a flight 14 hours later and 3 being denied entry to the country the government were denying foreign nationals even with a visa  which we had we want to go back to the seychelles when all this is over but sadly i fear it will need to be with another airline despite the stellar service of the staff on kq003 on the day we flew
115,cape town to amsterdam via nairobi in early march did fly before the vivid crisis missed our connection flight due to delay of the plane but found out later of that connection had been canceled kenya airways promised to give us a voucher as a compensation for the delay after several emails i have not received anything
116,i purchased a ticket back in december 2019 for a flight from kenya to italy due to covid19 the airline appropriately cancelled my trip however would not give me any sort of refund for the ticket price i reached out to them multiple times prior to the flight with no response or call back finally 2 days ago almost a month after my flight was scheduled i received a response stating that i did not qualify for a refund since it was a nonrefundable ticket even though they cancelled the flight they wouldnt even give me a travel voucher by this point if you can fly anyone else please do i had multiple international trips planned during this time and every other airline worked with me to refund my trip or provide me with flight vouchers kenya airways clearly does not care about customer service or having future customers
117,due to the covid 19 i had to cancel a flight to nairobi the cancellation was done on time early march well kenya airways refuses to refund my ticket and proposes a voucher to be used in the next twelve months on top of that no one responded to my email for over a month i really believe that this is not acceptable
118,airobi to mauritius this was the final leg of the itinerary from manchester to mauritius manchester to nairobi flown with qatar airways  flights sold by qatar airways this flight was a short 4 hour flight nairobi airport itself if not the best for transit though we spent the 7 hour layover in the pride business class lounge having paid 40 for a day pass which was satisfactory cabin crew appeared a little unfriendly on arrival onto aircraft though pleasant with requests and service the aircraft itself appeared old and tired and could benefit from modernisation for a small flight a light meal was provided which in honesty was good asian vegetarian sadly few flight announcements and no advice that the plane was descending into mauritius and landing  it just landed no inflight entertainment  screen did not work finally the timing of this flight is not good arrival at mauritius at 0300 in the morning is strange and untimely not sure why the schedule is this way but certainly not a time that i would be looking at again in the future in summary an ok airline  convenient to ensure qatar airways flights for the route but will look at alternatives to mauritius in the future put it this was if qatar airways either fly directly to mauritius or have a transit in seychelles or johannesburg then this would be the preferred option nairobi is ok but i think the experience with kenya airways is not something i would revisit as experienced
119,avelled kigali via nairobi to johannesburg and back within 2 days midmarch 2020 aircraft  were e190 on short leg and boeing 7878 on long legs all flights on time no luggage issues checked in online had to wait 1 hour in airport as they only open check in 2 hours before departure upgraded 1st leg kglnbo by a modest but successful online bid granted lounge access by courtesy in nairobi as my gold card was just earned during the same trip but of course not processed in their system in kigali they use pearl lounge which is deteriorating since rwandair opened a new lounge opposite kenya airways pride lounge in nairobi is wonderful food served onboard was substandard and particular breakfasts were a disgrace however drink supplies were fine i like the happy hours approach they use on regional routes like to dubai and jnb where you order a drink or wine and they often double up the order without asking i have only received this double up service before on gulf air and the now deceased jet airways that is generous positive approach and make one feel very appreciated and cared for in economy class where benefits otherwise are sparse fas are very good though advised an fa to avoid chewing gum as it is cause feeling of disrespect to some passengers champagne on business class is good and offered also before departure no ife on short legs but on long legs plenty of films to watch no wifi onboard i was given 3 seats on all flights were not full thanks to corona virus fear and close downs
120,airobi to daressalam it was a connection flight i booked the tickets from different companies separately this flight was the last resort to avoid losing my next flight and it got delayed more than an hour so i lost the next flight in the counter they said it was just not in the contract whatever could happen because of a delay of less than 3 hours
121,airobi to london heathrow awful simply awful substantial delays on both the outbound and return legs really poor customer service in response customer service was poor in general on board and at the airport when requesting an update to the flight i would not recommend kenya airways to anybody not even my worst enemy
122,johannesburg to kigali via nairobi 56 feb 2020 on boeing 7878 and  embraer 190 almost on time first flight fell 25 minutes late i had made a low but successful bid for 2nd leg to be upgraded as it also gave access to kenyas lounge in nairobi which is good and spacious ticket cheap bought from an online travel company kenya airways have reduced luggage allowance for regional flights with silver level in their flying blue ffp i eventually managed to get a 2nd huge suitcase added to be checkin first one included in ticket checkin transfers and communication went fine onboard great service lots of drinks as there seem to be a happy hour going on at afternoonevening flights whenever passengers ordered juice beer or wine they were instantly handed double up without discussion i love that attitude it gives a feeling of luxury i have experienced this before with kq on their dubai route food was good two options with the possibility to add up more as long stock lasted fas were fine call bells answered duty free sales onboard worked well the dreamliner is great but space provided in economy is humiliatingly small i was lucky to have 3 seats to myself to survive lack of leg and breathing space pride lounge in nairobi is a breeze and i slept well till next morning to catch last leg as being upgraded last leg morning flight nbokgl was uneventful of 9 business class seats 1 x 2 configuration no complaints apart from a joke of breakfast consisting of a tired reheated croissant no cheese only jam to supply champagne and coffeetea given on request
123,bangkok to johannesburg via nairobi on 5th february 2020 both flights on newer b7878 aircrafts checkin and luggage handling went smoothly but had to fight a bit with ground staff to get all my bps issued on spot booking handling online works well their afklm lounge offered in bangkok is poor like thai airways lounges but their pride lounge in nairobi is good and spacious hardware on kenya airways is good and they are good on ground to tackle even complicated issues the fas are also good plenty observant they are mainly kenyans which does not help chinese nor thai passengers much the very weak point of kenya airways is the food business class does not provide food any better than their economy class and is plain without vision looking shabby competing airlines like ethiopian turkish south african and egypt serves much better and inspiring food in their economy class steel cutlery and table preparation nice but thats it dinner from bkk was a cold shabby dish with chopped salad and 3 ridiculous small pieces of sliced meatballs breakfast offered was inedible continental or fried rice very poor offerings no meat no cocktails no cheeses no ice cream no smoothies chocolates no fruits watermelon does not count extremely poor catering a disgrace for the airline beverages are shamefully very sparse only 2 juices apple or orange are offered wines are only passable beers are cheap waterish industrial stuff 2 brands tusker and heineken  not providing any alternatives to each other no souvenir no pyjamas no luxury feelings at all no lobster no seafood no caviar no mutton goat pork no beef no chicken maybe inside the breakfast sausage fa staff admitted that economy class had the same catering as business though of course presented simpler 1st flight on time 2nd departed 1 hour late miles given quickly to flying blue i will go again when the price is right lower expectation to food to zero and eat well at home or in lounge then it can be fairly good value for money when prices are promoted
124,johannesburg to bangkok via nairobi as a fairly regular flier this was one of the most disappointing flights ive ever been on the boeing 787 is a great plane but from checkin to baggage collection and everything in between i was underwhelmed the aircraft interior is tatty and dirty with frayed seat covers and ripped seatback pockets that your phone falls through the holes the cabin service only started 45 minutes after takeoff no water or drinks and they first serve their very mediocre meals before you get a small plastic cup of water which we got 1 hour into the flight then the dirty trays only get cleared around an hour after meals are served so you cant stow the tray table and sleep until theyve cleared the cabin on both the flight to bangkok and the return sector i tried in vain to call a cabin attendant using the call button but they literally walk past you with the blue light glaring and carry on doing whatever theyre busy with i needed assistance on one occasion as the passenger next to me spilled their whole drink over me and i needed a towel to dry my leg and shoes but after 20 minutes i eventually switched off the light and gave up and slept with a wet leg on another occasion i needed the attendant to take my dirty food tray nearly a full hour after the meal had been served so that i could stow my fold down tray to get up to go to the bathroom but he refused to take it and said i must wait until they clear the whole cabin i chose kenya airways because it was the quickest trip with shortest connection and i assumed there would be similar service to af  klm with them being shareholders but if i ever fly to bangkok again from johannesburg i will certainly pay the extra money and take the longer layover in dubai or singapore and fly emirates or singapore airlines i will not fly kenya airways longhaul again unless its specifically to go to nairobi or elsewhere in east africa
125,just returned after spending nearly 10 hours at or tambo airport flight was cancelled due to a faulty spring on a flap while i recognise theses things happen i was appalled by the way the staff treated customers little or no information was given kq staff were almost completely absent except when tracked sent from pillar to post trying to find luggage no lunch vouchers provided then informed you had to rebook yourselves on flights so complete mayhem trying to get to the kq reservation desk back in the departures non airside counter was informed no compensation except for new booking would be provide and if needed a hotel i have family in pretoria so headed back to them incurring extra costs such as taxi fares but no compensation for these and all the other costs incurred let alone any compensation for wasting my and my 2 kids whole day losing a days work missing appointments etc am absolutely amazed at how badly kq staff in johannesburg are trained this is not the first time last year when they lost my luggage for 3 days kq staff at ortambo failed to inform me i was due 100 usd compensation i only found out when i arrived in nairobi and asked at the help desk in the arrival hall
126,cape town to mumbai via nairobi i have taken loads of flights in the last few years all across the world and this is by far the worst experience i have ever had our flight was delayed for over 10 hours because there was no crew availability because of that our connecting flight was missed and we were rescheduled to a flight which made us reach mumbai 25 hours late when we reached the airport the system was not working and we were given hand written boarding passes the process delayed the flight by more than 4 more hours the airline staff were clueless as they apparently said that the head office in nairobi was not picking their calls i dont know what is up with kenya airways its better to cancel the trip than to travel with them
127,airobi to mahe they cancelled our flight to mahe without notice we tried to check in evening before our departure date but their system indicated incorrect personal details we called customer service but they could not explain to us but instead said that we should check in at airport on arrival at airport our flight original time 1915 was cancelled so we couldnt catch our connecting flights we went to their office at entebbe and found a staff who was very unprofessional and unwilling to help when we indicated that we are gold members and frequent flyers and we wish to file a complaint and asked for her name then she was willing to assist us we missed our connecting flights paid hotel we did not sleep in sleepless night all they had to do is to inform us that our flight was cancelled and they didnt
128,johannesburg to mumbai via nairobi staff lack professionalism and can be quite brash and rude cabin was too hot even after take off and i requested if they could turn up the air but the cabin attendant didnt seem to understand my request far too much single use packaging  throwaway boxes plastic cutlery when they could just as easily use stainless steel cutlery no special meals on 24 of my flights and staff insisted this was not booked even when i was presented with my meal on 2 of other legs had to wait at least 30 minutes both times in nairobi in the plane after landing in the heat as ground staff got the disembarkation ready but no apology or explanation from cabin staff for keeping people standing in the hot crowded airplane staff lack warmth and are robotic and the attention to service when compared with other airlines on similar routes is noticeably absent
129,cape town to zanzibar via nairobi worst experience of my life we booked online directly from kenya airways on the 2nd nov and the money was deducted on the 8th november the day we booked we noticed a flight was cancelled and we phoned them to make sure seeing as we didnt receive an eticket the woman said its no problem we will receive our ticket the moment the flight is sorted we just need our booking reference on the 15th dec we were suppose to fly at 2300 with checkin they couldnt find our ticket and was sent to ticket sales ticket sales confirmed that we had paid and that we have a booking but no tickets were issued when kenya was finally reached they said they never received our payment 25 hours later we missed our flight next day we start phoning them at 7am when they finally answered they started this thing where they will tell you to please hold but end the line after the fourth call we got through and the woman said we can fly at 1430 at 10am we were at the airport at ticket sales once again no eticket and no response by 1230 we get the news we have to pay for new tickets at a larger price than our previous tickets and they will refund our original price  the absolute audacity we lost our vacation and accommodation and these people wanted to charge us extra customer service is enough to make even the most calm and professional person lose it completely we received a proof of refund and on the proof it shows that they received our money on the 6th november
130,johannesburg to dubai via nairobi first and last time travelling on kenya airway firstly the flight took forever to take off and i had a connecting flight in nairobi which eventually had me running like a mad dog and almost missed my connecting flight this kenya airways first time experience did not stop here after landing and to this very moment my luggage is missing try having a holiday and you have no luggage and no one is helping at kenya airways never again
131,amsterdam to antananarivo via nairobi it was my first time i have flown with kenya airways and it was quite positive experience the cabin crew were friendly and provided really good service with the smile we were afraid about delays and lost baggage but everything was fine and on time
132,mauritius to amsterdam via nairobi we tried to change our ticket as some free seats were available this information we got at different airport so we showed up at the desk by gate 1516 and the lady there just left us without a word we were quite in rush because we had an option to change the flight when she came back told us that it is too late and we should go to gate 6 and check for another flight and they will provide the service we went there waiting 30 mins no one showed up so i went to the previous gate desk to ask for assistance she called a few numbers and informed me that her colleague is there all the time when i went back to the desk by gate 6 my friend told me that she just arrived 2 mins ago and she is not able to help us as she doesnt have codes and we need to wait for someone else an hour we waited for another person and she couldnt help us too we kept waiting for 3rd person another 40 mins who said that we cant change the ticket coz the plan is full they could tell us at the first time my experience in general was positive
133,great flight from new york to dar es salaam via nairobi smooth connections good food good service comfortable plane no problems comparable to my flights on austrian airlines from vienna to new york
134,worst online customer service i have ever seen it took more than days to get back to me regarding a change on flights when it finally replied it gave me the available date however refused to get the payment through email as we are dealing and sent me to the branch in a city far from where i was staying to do the payment when i got there as soon as i could possibly could and the flight was simply booked out i lost money and time to find out i would have to stay until my flight was originally booked
135,"
london to mauritius via nairobi this is the first time i have flown with kenya airways and i was impressed the cabin crew were very friendly and provided an excellent service there was good leg room and the seats were comfortable the inflight entertainment was touchscreen and provided a large selection of movies to watch three meals were provided during the 2 flights my only issue was the long transit in nairobi 8 hours on the way to mauritius the transit on the journey back was quick only 2 hours i will definitely fly kenya airways again as it was the cheapest option to mauritius and provided great value for money"
136,airobi to new york  the food is below average for someone who is paying almost 1000 for a flight we received what they called a omelette which was really like the folded egg from mcdonalds chicken with rice and a buffalo chicken sandwich that was terrible completely unacceptable at the quality given to customers kenya airways also had a separate security checkpoint after three were already done in the airport at the gate in which anyone who purchased a beverage walking in the airport and then went to their gate were told it had to be consumed right then or thrown out water in the airport is 3 i saw at least 10 passengers who had to throw their water out and some after being told by a worker who sold them the water that they would be fine to board the plane also an observation we were the only one with a checkpoint done by the airline at the gate we walked by all other gates and saw people sitting like you normally would so why would this airline impose a checkpoint for those going to the us after already being checked by the airport and customs this left a bad taste after a great trip do better kenya airways your food and customer service sucks
137,airobi to zanzibar my experience involves booking a flight with another airline not kenya airways and money being deducted and cancelled on the day of travel while at the airport with my family only for kenya airways to book me a flight and save me all expenses from flight to hotel bookings i had made i booked a flight with another airline from nairobizanzibar money was deducted but i was not issued a ticket i was at nairobi on the day of travel waiting to get the tickets and travel with my family we were told the airline had canceled our tickets  later on the airline would refund me the money deducted  a ticket lady booked us a flight to zanzibar and she went further to assist us with immigrations so that we do not miss the flight eventually i was on time for checking in at zanzibar after a pleasant journey where the captain kept updating us  we received awesome service as we had travelled with an infant 15 year old both to and fro
138,my family of four flew business class bangkok to nairobi return i had purchased my business class ticket and 3 economy tickets for my family 6 months in advance all at a great price my family got upgraded to business class 48 hours before each flight based on a computerized bidding system although it is not guaranteed you will get the seats in our case it saved us thousands of dollars on our business class airfares kenya uses a 2x2x2 seat configuration in a two cabin business class design three rows in the front cabin and two rows in the next cabin the second cabin is quieter and more desirable the flight attendants both kenyan and thai were great  very friendly and attentive since both our flights were red eyes we went right to sleep for the 9 hour flight and did not eat the first meal the prearrival meal was breakfast and was fine the ife was just average with a limited number of movies most over a year old i fly a lot of long haul business class flights and usually prefer the individual pods but in this case with my family the two side by side business class seats were very comfortable in fact they had longer leg room and were wider than the pods allowing you to sleep easily on your side without feeling constricted we all got 78 hours of sleep our first flight arrived 45 minutes early our second flight 30 minutes late all in all a comfortable flight with very good service
139,london to nairobi delayed flight over four hours no compensation at all forth coming my ba flight was delayed a little while ago and i had a compensation without any issues in a month kenya airways are making a mockery of the eu law i think this is basically a broke matatu airline and best be avoided its a disgrace to the country
140,after all the negative reviews i was quite nervous about flying with kenya airways but everything was fine flight out was on time staff friendly and meals decent return journey from johannesburg was delayed and bags left behind in nairobi but staff were apologetic and bags delivered intact the next day to my door bag delay has happened previously with another major airline so not too bother i would fly with kenya airways again as it is reasonably cheap and pretty decent
141,we missed our 830am kenya airways flight the airlines fault not ours from nairobi to kilimanjaro the staff at the kenya airways desk initially insisted that we pay the full fare for a new flight at 500pm when we refused to do so they said there were business class seats available on the 130pm flight which we could have for the difference between economy and business we were told twice that the difference was us210 per person we reluctantly agreed to pay but specified we would pay by credit card so we had a paper trail when we subsequently complained to ka we were told that if we paid cash we could pay at the kenya airways desk if we insisted on paying by card we would have to go back through security but another visa as we had technically left kenya and pay at the ka desk on the concourse when my partner eventually got to the kenya airways concourse desk the staff insisted that he needed to pay cash when he refused they suggested they would void the reserved business class seats he continued to insist on paying by card at this point the price for the upgrade mysteriously dropped from us210 to us184 per person our conclusion was that the relevant kenya airways staff had intended to take the additional us52 as a commission  by the way my partner wasnt required to buy another visa and we discovered on the flight that our upgrade to business class entitled us to the grand total of a glass of water and a wet towel we will never use kenya airways again
142,johannesburg to nairobi the plane broke down and the situation was handled in the most unprofessional way the passenger was not informed on time of the technical problems the kenya airways staff was not helpful at all the better the situation the arrangement with regards to rescheduling and accomodation was also very unprofessional passengers were not guide where to pick up luggage and what to do next i will definitely not recommend kenya airways as a airways of choice
143,i was to fly on sept 7thÂ 1055 pm kenya time from nairobi to new yorkjfk i got to the airport and cleared 3 rounds of security checks after reaching the boarding gate it was announced that the flight is delayed and now will depart at 1 am Â  around 930 they made another announcement that the flight is further delayed and will depart at 2 am we were offered some dinner and around midnight asked to proceed towards the boarding gate where there was another round of security clearance there is no water available beyond this point unless its a sealed bottle bought at dutyfree Â  at around 245 when there was no sight of a plane and when we inquired with the ground staff kenya airways personnel made an announcement that the flight is canceled and will now depart at 2 pm the next day Â  we were given transit visa voucher however upon getting to the immigration line were told the voucher is void without ka personnel signature by this time all of us were frustrated due to lack of proper communication and guidance Â  after we cleared the long queue at immigration we got to the ka desk for the hotel reservation there was no clarity or communication around hotel assignment we had to hand over our boarding passes at random to agents whod then shout out the names of passengers as the lines grew longer their ability to manage crowds and cater to our needs diminished  they were not able to answer simple questions such as which hotel to go to when our busshuttle would arrive or what the process would be thereafter Â  we managed to get to our assigned hotel at around 430 am the wifi in the room was not working so we could not communicate with family regarding our whereabouts the bedspread was torn and the bathroom had roaches and other insects with barely 3 hours of sleep we woke up to get breakfast which was below average Â  we left for the airport by airport shuttle where the ka agent only provided boarding pass for the flight to jfk the agent asked me to go to the gate to collect boarding pass for the flight from jfk phx after reaching the gate i was asked to go to the ka desk so the agent can further help with flight changes i had specifically requested to be booked onto an earlier flight which the agent at the main counter confirmed was the case however the agent at the ka desk near the gates could not help and said they could book me only on the 8 am flight to phoenix the following day  after an 8hour wait at jfk airport she said my seat was confirmed for this flight the agent also confirmed my bags would be checked all the way through to phoenix and just that i had to collect my boarding pass at ka counter at jfk Â  at the fourth security check i asked another ka agent if my bags would be through checked to phoenix  she said i would have to collect them at the port of entry which is nyjfk  the flight which was to depart at 2 pm was delayed by an hour and departed nairobi at around 3 pm the inflight service was poor the agents were rude i asked the attendant for an additional blanket as i started feeling the chills but i never got any Â  we landed at jfk around 1030 pm after clearing customsimmigration transiting passengers were advised to meet the ground staff there was no ground staff at jfk for us to meet so at around 1145 pm after clearing customs i along with another passenger headed to the ka counters on level 2boarding gates area the staff had left for the day so we decided
144,london heathrow to lusaka via nairobi flights full on outward leg evening meal provided and a small breakfast box on 787 another small breakfast box identical to the original one and equally poor  a tiny croissant and a small bun on the flight from nairobi to lusaka kenya airways food is going downhill  flown with them before and the food was more substantial return flight  lusaka to nairobi via harare  a packet of salted nuts and a drink nairobi to london  lunch was a very small offering allegedly breakfast of a poached egg and spinach  again in a cardboard box this is not the way for a cash strapped airline to attract or keep customers cabin crews were unsmiling but did the job all flights were on time which was good  but if you are looking for seat comfort forget it  seats were hard and narrow  the seats need refreshing
145,london to lusaka via nairobi kenya airways is strapped for cash and it shows on all four legs of this trip food was very poor indeed  on three legs we were served identical breakfast boxes which consist of a tiny croissantand a small cake  no butter etc that was all on the outward leg from london to nairobi there was also a reasonable evening meal but on the return leg the lunch was miniscule there were no visible water runs and the cabin crews did little outside the meal service marketing seems to use the wrong strategy to keep customers  the whole concept of customer service seems to be going in the reverse direction both aircraft types are clean but the seats are so hard and uncomfortable from years of use having flown with them before the whole trip was very disappointing on the credit side the flights were all on time if kenya airways want to attract and keep customers they should review the so called meal options and not advertise breakfast on the e tickets when it clearly does not apply a breakfast box is not a meal  buy something at the airport 
146,kigali to dubai via nairobi 5th october 2019 e190 and b787800 aircraft all on time check in smooth online where i was notified by kq 36 hours prior to kickoff in airport things went well granted access to rwandairs dream lounge as the usual business lounge is under renovation on the first flight business class was full and people were cramped in 1 x 2 configuration for solo travellers its important to select the single seats on the left column a welcome champagne given provided the passengers request it otherwise it is not offered they had two food options veg or chicken which both were ridiculous loaded from nairobi 1 to pick of chicken or vegs with a ground potato cake total some 50 grams served on a disgusting seats are classic business class with limited reline cannot justify the high price tag for business class on short flights in nairobi i used the wonderful pride lounge to catch up with premier league the longer leg nbodxb was much nicer and a true business class experience i had two hot kinds of hot meals and they were both acceptable fish and steak staff wellrested and in a sparkling mood ife fine roomy lie flat beds food is deteriorating really bad and poor compared to earlier years of glory no quality beers and only 1 or 2 wines offered and the 2 beer brands they offer are just industrialised mass products of low quality however i rate kq fairly high due to their good lounges good flights on widebody aircrafts nice fas and ability to handle irregularities
147,airobi to new york i paid for business class roundtrip my return flight was delayed until 230 am and then cancelled i was stranded for one night in nairobi and then another night in new york and then they never actually booked my connecting flight yet they swore the entire time that i had a ticket i have tried for a month to get a refund and they wont respond the customer service is routed through a call center in india that is absolutely worthless i tried calling their home office in nairobi no toll free number so incurred international charges and got hung up on before anyone could help me twice emails are ignored i am by far not the only one having these problems either
148,airobi to mahe extremely poor customer service from kenya airways today after delaying our flight kq 250 by 4hr 15mins meaning everyone is missing their connection they offer no compensation no solution refuse to call the seychelles airlines to ask them for help i expect to receive a refund for the inconvenience
149,my flight from dubai to mauritius to transit through nairobi was so bad they delayed us in dxb for 2 hours and when arriving at nairobi the flight to mauritius already left i had to reconnect to johannesburg waiting for 8 good hours without any help of any rebooking or a hotel to rest arrived in johannesburg at 1 am the morning i have to wait for another 9 hours before the flight to mauritius the journey of 1 day takes almost 3 days i wouldnt recommend they have wasted my time
150,johannesburg to paris return kenya airways does the job but dont expect much more than flying from a to b on the good side flight hours are convenient from johannesburg to paris and route is short flights were all on time with short connections kq is part of the afklm flying blue programme and thats very convenient im silver and got 3x23 kilos fas were fine and as already experienced on kq they tended to be very generous on alcohol on the downside kq offers very poor service ife is extremely poor with a very limited choice of films most being rather old films and the selection did not change between late july and late august besides ife did not always work fine sound problem on one flight food was very limited and very bad particularly on 8 hour flight to paris no real dinner but just a fat meat roll breakfast very bad  but food better from cdg as on so many airlines nbo airport is small and clean it was not crowded but very dull and very limited service ground staff at or tambo wanted us to pay for our childrens car seats about  400 because on the website it was written that car seats were free for infants and they said children aged 4 and 9 are not infants  very absurd rule hopefully the agent at the ticketing office was shocked by the price and sorry for us and finally they dropped the surcharge as always be kind with ground staff and stay calm yet we saw latter the same ground staff member telling very rudely to a passenger going to malawi that he would have to pay for a notsobig cabin bag he was carrying kqs service is clearly very poor and among african airlines saa and ethiopian while far from being perfect offer better service particularly ife food and cabins

bangkok to harare via nairobi my first leg flight from bangkok to nairobi was delayed by 5 hours on 30 august from 0140 to 610 on arrival in nairobi i could still have caught my flight to harare but was told it had been cancelled they were trying to put another flight together i was told to sit and wait i waited from approximately 1000 am to 1300 pm i was told that a mistake had been made as i had been rebooked to go to lusaka at approximately 1500 i finally got a new boarding pass and was taken to a hotel by the time all procedures were done i arrived at the hotel after 1700 pm we were told to return to the desk by 2000 hrs for the 1159 flight i eventually arrived in harare at 0200 am on sunday instead of 1540 pm on saturday on my return a week later the hararenairobi leg was fine on arrival in nairobi i was told to go to transfer desk and knew instantly that another ordeal was starting the flight had been delayed by approximately 6 hours again the flight is leaving tomorrow morning and we have booked you in a hotel they told me i had to take a crowded old bus with loud music playing we arrived at the hotel late and had just over two hours before our departure for the airport throughout all this i never got an apology or any kind words i resolved that i would never take kenya airways as long as they cancel and delay flights this way"
152,johannesburg to london heathrow via nairobi i cant fault this airline faultless journey great crew new aircraft flights on time my second trip to europe with kenya airways in the last couple of months they are now my airline of choice thank you star alliance for doing me over with your hard to find small print otherwise id have never tried kq
153,cape town to addis ababa via nairobi i booked two weeks ago to attend a hospitality conference addis ababa flying there by night booked business class and economy for my return as it is a day flight the transit time is good on both legs until yesterday when i was informed that timetables have changed and i now have 5 hrs to wait at jka for the return flight to cape town as a frequent flyer kq i asked their customer service if i could be given a voucher for the business lounge as they had made the changes the short retort was no my retort to kenyan airways  i have now cancelled my booking and will be flying ethiopian airways direct from cape town to addis ababa return no wonder kenya airways is also experiencing hard times it all relates to service on the ground and in the air you have now lost 930 plus what i may have spent at the airport duty free and my views of flying the pride of africa has changed
154,w york to nairobi i flew jfk to nairobi nonstop on 10 august 2019 and returned on 1 september the website is horrible much like the online entertainment system the worst is their customer service the flight attendants are rude cold and reluctant to even give out cups of water flight is nonstop and 1415 hours service is unbelievably terrible every flight attendant was rude the bathrooms were dirty and were not cleaned or restocked duringthe entire flight unsanitary and disgusting this airline is subpar and should be reviewed by health departments the staff should be replaced or retrained there are plenty of kenyan citizens who could use the work this is especially sad because kenyan people are so nice and go out of their way to help each other and others
155,dubai to kigali via nairobi on time kq cannot handle transit luggage in dubai anymore this happens frequently to me as i often travel on a different ticket onwards from dxb when transiting one has to hire a ground handling company dnata  and pay them 90 usd to retag two suitcases forward instead i opted to pass twice not only immigration but also security and train commuting had to reclaim my bags and check them in again at landside otherwise everything went perfect i sleep well on the boeing 787 prefer the middle seats on 2nd row fas pleasurable and i allowed them to change my seat i bought the tickets a year in advance and could at that time not connect easily to kigali from nairobi earlier flights are now available but i opted not to change and killed my 12 hours in pride lounge in nairobi with pleasure and in great comfort last flight on embraer also faultless but inflight service poor and food is a joke a single cold unappetizing sandwich i wonder what they can serve cheaper for economy class beers and wine available but hidden not displayed on wagons business class was full and people were cramped in 1 x 2 configuration headsets were for economy class and only given on request luggage delivered at belt as some of the very last ones more than 35 minutes after passing immigration no point of priority tags delay caused by examination of all bags prior to releasing them i could hear the sniffing dogs they use to disclose drugs an airport thing but passengers are suffering from this which also apply for departures i still rate kq fairly high due to good lounges good first flight nice fas and ability to handle irregularities
156,airobi to johannesburg return both flights delayed a 3hour delay out of nairobi with no prior communication from the airline despite the fact that they ask for both your phone number and email address when you check in online i actually received a text advising me of the delay after we landed in johannesburg a full 3 hours late apparently the delay was caused by a technical issue with the airplane scheduled to operate the flight but the chaos at nairobi airport and a glance at the departure board showed most kenya airways flights delayed on the day for anything up to 8 hours im skeptical that a technical issue on one airplane could cause that many delays given the size of the airline and the different aircraft types it operates the flight itself was fine despite several irate passengers taking their frustration out verbally on the cabin crew who kept up a cheerful demeanor as much as they could food on kq is nothing special a tiny main course and a bread roll and bit of cake entertainment options are fine but dont seem to be updated much return flight from johannesburg two days later also delayed 1 hour due to the flight departing nairobi late this time apparently they had a medical emergency with a passenger just after pushing back from the gate in nairobi which meant they had to go back and put the unfortunate person in an ambulance not the airlines fault i suppose but frustrating nonetheless when constant delays are the norm with the airline these days being a frequent traveler to johannesburg i think ill use their competitor on the route in future
157,amsterdam to dar es salaam via nairobi during the outward journey i had a threehour delay from nairobi to dar es salaam the airport in nairobi has very poor facilities so the wait was very unpleasant during the flight to dar es salaam i left my headphones on the chair a day later i contacted immediately but apparently my headphones disappeared in a mysterious way i contacted the company several times but after their first reaction they found it too difficult to answer my followup questions the return journey was even more dramatic my flight was moved from the morning to the evening without consultation i had received an email about this so i wanted to checkin in the evening but this was not possible the change was passed on to me but apparently was not in the airport system so i had to wait an hour and a half at customer service the lady who thought her phone was more important than her customers couldnt help me according to her the fault lay with me because i had booked the flight via klm i went to the klm office just in time the staff there were able to check me in within five minutes and clearly stated that the fault was with kenya airways fortunately i was just able to make my flight how lucky that i booked the flight via klm the organization of kenya airways is lacking at every level
158,im very happy with the service i had a flight from bangkok via nairobi to addis originally i booked the flight with a transit time in nairobi so i arrived in the morning and the original flight was supposed to go in the evening in bangkok they also checked me in for the second flight in nairobi although i had the boarding pass i didnt realize that the time had changed to the morning flight i was so sure that the flight would be in the evening that i read the time 635 as the evening time although thats obviously in the morning when i finally realized this they booked me on the next flight for the next morning and booked a hotel with 2 meals included plus the shuttle all for free so very thankful for everything and i also got the transit visa renewed without extra cost i can recommend this airline for the good service and my good impression i had for the flight from bangkok to nairobi thanks a lot kenya airways

160,w york to dar es saalam via nairobi we will never fly this airline again we flew jfk to nairobi nonstop on june 29th and returning on july 11th firstly the customer service is unbelievably terrible every stewardess  was rude and never helped  they huffed and puffed when you kindly requested something as simple as some water flight was over 14 12 hours secondly they refused to accommodate anyone for seat changes even when the customer is paying the upcharge third we requested to get skymiles added from this trip and they refuse to give us our credit due to our class they are a part of the skyteam we spent extra money on exit row seats and spent a lot of money for the tickets how are we not getting any mileage credit built up from this this is probably the number one reason i will never fly with this airline ever again i am so angry with this bathrooms were dirty and never cleaned or restocked there was several times that i had to walk to the back of the plane to find a stewardess and ask them to put more toilet paper in the bathroom or if there was any way they could clean the urine off the floor in every single one of the bathrooms we paid for exit seats for the additional leg room and the stewardesses never said anything to the 15 people that decided to congregate in my extra leg room area and stand there conversating for over 2 hrs i asked them kindly to relocate several times and even said something to the stewardesses several times finally they moved after i had to make them very frustrating i didnt pay all this extra money for me not to be able to extend my legs the only good thing i can say about this airline is they got us from point a to point b
161,dubai to kigali via nairobi on 30th june 2019 on b787800 and e190 respectively my ticket was in economy and very cheap i bid for an upgrade for the 1st leg and it was accepted 2 days before and they reissued ticket however due to serious delays by cathay pacific entering dubai from saigon and hong kong i realised almost a day before that i would not be able to make my trip from dxb i cancelled my online checkins to avoid no show but had to forfeit upgrade and tickets according to fare rules however kq and in particular the station manager in dxb went the extra mile to still get me on board on the following flight 5 hours later on the same day this without reissuing tickets which were non refundable without charging me for no show without loosing my upgrade just out of courtesy empathy and a well explained case from my side at gate in dxb i was the last person had only 40 minutes for transfer so got a good morning run but kq issued all my bps in 2 minutes during last call onboard spacious cabin got seat 2c in a nice 2 x 2 x 2 configuration flight full except a few seats in business good food and kind attentive fas a decent airline respecting classic values and handles ground situations or irregularities well not the first time they have done small miracles for me in nbo i was kindly invited to the kq pride lounge that skyteam uses just a courtesy due to my endured inconveniences last leg on an e190 i love this aircraft dinner and drinks served in a good atmosphere due to fresh fas well done kq outstanding service i owe you for this one and my hometravel is still valid what more could you have done i cant see it

163,johannesburg to nairobi super impressed with kenya airways bright and airy cabin on the boeing 737800 very attentive crew and nothing was too much trouble food excellent and possibly the best steak ive ever had on board
164,addis ababa to kigali via nairobi on 1617th may 2019 on b737 and e90 respectively got my ticket reissued in airport in add due to no show i was late from previous connection on different ticket that costed me 300 usd same amount as i paid for original return ticket the station manager in add went the extra mile to get me onwards the same day and he invited me to the ethiopian gold lounge that skyteam uses service onboard fair but food is ridiculous and substandard they serve only microscopic meals eg a littlefinger sized hot roll snack from add to nbo 5 hours trip thats stingy in nbo i had to spent the night but fortunately kq granted me lounge access due to all the trouble that i have had the prestigious lounge has food views and nice architecture with curving designs and view of tarmac it has 6 beds in silent area and i slept well till next morning flights less than Â½ hours delayed nbokgl on the embraer was delayed due to passengers could not fit their overhead luggage into the narrow space and some 510 pax was deprived their luggage to have it inscribed on site and put down in luggage room until we reached kgl for me a dramatic flight as i had 6 bps issued with kq and lost 2 connections from add but the station manager did well to rebook me kq has lowered services onboard but remain strong when things go wrong no ife on any of these 3 regional flights
165,bangkok to addis ababa via nairobi transited in bkk from vietnam and boarded after midnight 15th may 2019 aircraft were the old boeing 7878 and 737 respectively i like kq we have had our issues in bkk they were professional and appeared as a true legacy carrier this even i travelled on a strongly promoted ticket smooth cooperation with kq and the af lounge in bkk allowed me to relax in the lounge 6 hours until kenya airways could issue all 4 boarding passes of my ongoing trip to kigali via addis buying 2 tickets with complicated routing married segments turned out to be much cheaper than go direct but time spent increases likewise the risk of lapses all flights punctual food only passable only 2 options offered and only cold dishes for dinner no cheese no icecream other airlines do better in economy regarding food drinks also very narrow offering with 2 industrial cheap beers same for wines only 12 options champagne offered on both flights was fine jm gobillard  fils the boeing 7878 offer a very boring and cramped layout of 2x2x2 in 5 rows business almost full only 4 vacant seats and economy completely full but no operational upgrades were done second flight almost empty poor food only a quiche in a paper box offered as breakfast and this was business class fas in excellent mood had 50 minutes turnaround time in add which i failed to complete in time due to no prior notification by kq aircrew to ground staff to rush me through
166,airobi to new york most uncomfortable flight ive been on im 54 and my knees were in the back of the seat in front of me the food is terrible and drinks are few and far between the movie selection is slim and the earphones are janky i guess you get what you pay for but ill never fly this airline again it was this way both ways on our trip
167,airobi to dakar via abidjan i have no idea why the airline is called the pride of africa maybe because it compares to some other very bad airlines in the region ok the plane seemed good and the seats had a ptv which is pretty good and a newly introduced feature thats about it at jomo kenyatta the check in was slow even for those having done a check in online we had to wait in a line no one told us which line to wait in and of course no drop off line unlike advertised in the web page  and there is no point in using the self check in machines as you still have to go on the line  inside the airport which is not the fault of the airline it is really hot and crowded but the airline did not help because their boarding was done all at the same time no groups once in the tarmac maybe because they wanted to use only one bus they waited a long time until we were really crowded and people started complaining and saying they would not get in the bus then they took us to the plane where we waited about 5 to 10 minutes on the tarmac again luckily it was sunny we board the plane and have to wait almost one hour because the pilots do not have a flight plan i go to the toilet even before taking off and it is very dirty already food was really bad for an almost 10h flight seat covers were falling off some seats entertainment is good but there is a problem every time you open a new film or show or whatever it shows you the same publicity again we are already flying kenya airways no need to see the publicity 20 times the publicity lasts about 7 minutes and runs over the show so once your movie or show begins youve lost a few minutes of it  that is something that they must fix in the stopover we were advised that we had to wait in the plane about 30 minutes we waited 2h without air conditioning over 40 degrees people complaining doors closed and of course no apu on nor auxiliary power why  food from abidjan to dakar was really bad  a cold hard muffin and a mince pie that tasted so bad and was so dry many did not eat it anyways for a 2h flight you cant expect much but in total it is a 10h flight for many so it is rubbish both landings were quite hard and i am an airline fan and private pilot the second one can be justified due to wind but the first one surprised about it in general very good plane nice flight attendants and good entertainment system food was very bad the heat episode was ridiculous the delay was annoying and the landings were not too good plane felt dirty i like the airline but needs to improve
168,i flew kenya airways on my return flight from lilongwe to amsterdam via nairobi kenya airways connects lilongwe with nairobi through a direct and different stopover flights via lusaka and nampula i took the direct flight which leaves lilongwe at 240 at night and lands in nairobi 2 hours later check in at lilongwes kamuzu international airport is slow but so effective that all passengers were checked in time and the flight left 40 minutes early the worn down embraer e190 was clean and had personal inflight entertainment with a few movies and series the service was basic a small breakfast and drinks were handed out the flight landed in time in nairobi transfer through jomo kenyatta international airport is rather fast and efficient definetly the airport to transfer through in africa the 8h 20min flight from nairobi to amsterdam was on a b787800 although it was worn down the seat was comfortable and the inflight entertainment system was very good with a wide selection of movies and series service was good and the food was okay the flight was on time in amsterdam and i am happy to fly with kenya airways again in the future
169,flew with kq on new york to nairobi  kgljfk via nbo jfknbo flight was quite full and left 30mins late as it waited for connecting passengers even then arrived nairobi 50 mins early due to the strong tail wind and it was very bumpy flight cabin crew was attentive enough meal was just adequate enough lunch was served 1hour into the flight and breakfast was served before landing in nairobi in between there is only snack there should be a dinner service as it was a quite long flight the seat lacks padding for 14 hours nonstop flight seat pitch and seat width are decent avod entertainment was provided however the choice of movie was very limited and listed mostly old movies which mostly i have seen ended up watching some foreign language movies which i enjoyed them kglnbo flight was late due to arrival flight from nairobi it was a embraer 190 craft seat was very comfortable which i wish they put them on the transcontinental flight we were bused into the nbo terminal upon arrival had to run and cut the security screening line to make it to the gate that bound to jfk flight waited to get all the connecting passengers and luggage loaded onboard the flight left about 50 mins late and arrived jfk on time nbojfk flight has different avod entertainment menu as it was a month later from jfknbo flight the movie lineup was updated with new movies flight crew was attentive water rounds came around every 1 hour or so toilets were kept cleaned all in all everything went well i only have 3 things to suggest to improve  seat padding headphone audio was quality so bad and could not understand the dialogs and the quality of blanketpillow they were very thin and debris of red blanket fabric stuck all over on the cloths
170,airobi to lilongwe i came into nairobi on an air france flight from paris connecting on kenya airways flight to lilongwe compared to addis ababa nairobis airport seems very organized and the security check was fast there was good wifi and charging ports in the waiting area kenya airways uses the small embraer e190 on its 2h and 10min flight to lilongwe aircraft seemed outdated and wasnt the cleanest but i felt comfortable and legroom was quite good i preordered vegan lacto ovo breakfast which consisted of a sweet and a savory samosa both very tasty although it was a bit disappointing that the inflight entertainment system was not working the captain pointed out the kilimanjaro as we passed which made up for this flight was on time in lilongwe so far i tried ethiopian and malawian airlines in africa and would choose kenya airways over those two because transferring in nairobi is much more relaxed than addis abeba
171,w york to entebbe via nairobi 6 sectors flown in three weeks and very impressed by their package generally all flights on time good service in the air entertainment system excellent on boeing 787 to nyc three good meals provided and amplealthough very poor qualitycheap spirits offered refreshments transiting through nairobi at night is tedious  far too few security desks open and ruins the good work being done on the ground the additional security measures at jkia for the us bound flights really are something else staff excellent something great about boarding a flight in new york to a smiling kenyan cabin crew and flight crew taking you back home the intraafrica flights on kq are extremely expensive lusaka  entebbe was 400 usd but the entebbe  new york  is an absolute bargain  sadly for kq but amazing for me the both flights ex new york were a third full  leaving a whole row to lie out and rest the direct flight really deserves to succeed  i had cleared immigration and picked up my bags within 15 minutes of landing wonderful
172,johannesburg to nairobi with kenya airways food choices poor no alternative or vegetarian option two drink trolleys on an 8 hour flight my suitcase has been broken during transport staff not overly helpful on flight
173,i cannot thank the ground staff of kenyan airways at nairobi airport enough as a result of bad paperwork i found myself stranded on friday february 22 2019 not able to flying to drc with no phone no internet no entry visa or hotel the staff of kenyan airways got me settled within an hour my problems were solved and i was on my way to a hotel in downtown nairobi it is nice to see that some companies still believe in customer service the paperwork is sorted out and i will be flying on kenyan airways to drc tomorrow
174,monrovia to bangkok via nairobi in october 2018 the flight monrovia to nairobi with a stop in accra is on a b737 the flight nairobi to bangkok on a b787 i also did a number of other flights the past years eg entebbe  hanoi  johannesburg  bangkok both flights last year as well as the ones earlier were on time staff was friendly  service was good amenities in business class and choice of movies are limited but food  wines are very good the only problem i encountered was that one of my suitcases was lost when returning to monrovia but got it back in good condition 3 days after
175,bangkok to nairobi boarded at 12 midnight and were in the plane on the tarmac for 45 hrs and told to disembark since engineers had failed to fix a technical problem the staff was rough and the hotel we were driven was not ready as the airline had not told them of people coming it took me 4 days to travel from harare to melbourne a trip that was supposed to take 36hrs the worst airline i have used
176,paris to nairobi the kenya airways crew must be the least informed individuals working in airline industry they did not understand the language of my travel documents italian so they delayed my boarding and when they finally figured it out it was too late for me to board and they could not be bothered to put me on another flight so i booked with a different airline to be able get to my destination in time their confusion was not the worst i had sent them my documents prior to my booking and they said everything was okay but obviously that was a lie since here i am annoyed by their treatment and having to be ashamed of the one airline i should be most proud of based on my nationality kq should do better the food that pasta in some sort of fish sauce is horrible and please get coffee and tea flasks that do not look like you bought them from second hand market or used since independence your carry the kenyan name with little to no pride do better
177,bangkok to nairobi kenya airways flight kq887 was delayed by over 8 hours they put us in a dodgy old and stuffy hotel in bangkok overnight not only was the hotel room full of mosquitoes and horrible bathrooms but we also had an 8 hour lay over in nairobi which was not in our initial arrangements we were sent to wooden chairs and fed cold burgers with warm drinks kenya airways by far not the pride of africa in fact not even remotely 
178,harare to new york via nairobi i was super excited to travel to zimbabwe and see africa for the first time and got the perfect excuse when one of my closest friends from college planned her wedding in harare my outbound flight on american airlines was cancelled due to weather leading to me missing my connecting flight on kenya airways while this was unpleasant no one can control the weather and aa helped rebook me on a later kenya airways flight into harare zimbabwe so i made it on time to the wedding after a few weeks of seeing victoria falls and making friends with lions i got back to check into my flight back to new york with kenya airways the attendant there let me know that i had been marked as a noshow on my outbound flight and now my return ticket was cancelled as a result after arguing that i clearly was rebooked on a later outbound flight kenya airways told me i could get on the flight if i paid a penalty of 1200 as i had already paid for a round trip ticket i indignantly refused to pay for my flight a second time and wound up missing the morning flight two more flights back to the states came and went and i missed all of those flights as kenya airways demanded payments to let me onto a plane i racked up hours of international cell phone call payments with american airlines customer service and my travel agent who all let me know that kenya airways was not picking up the phone and they were the only ones who could get me on one of their planes 16 hours later having missed every flight that day i finally gave in and paid the 1200 penalty in addition to the 1600 round trip ticket i had already paid and kenya airways let me on the flight back home for the privilege of nearly doubling the cost of my plane ticket i also had a 17 hour layover in nairobi after which kenya airways told me my flight to jfk was overbooked fortunately kenya airways did one thing right and found a seat for me onto the flight back to the states which i had paid for twice all in all i wound up spending nearly four days total in airplanes and airports racking up international phone charges and nearly doubling the cost of my kenya airways ticket kenya airways the pride of africa
179,johannesburg to bangkok via nairobi the feeling i got flying kenya airways for the first and last time is that its missing a certain culture which is so important for customer loyalty our trip  was the worst ive ever taken with any airline and ive flown a lot everything was matter of fact except for the last leg from nairobi to cape town through victoria falls which was still the wrong return flight and 24 hours too late all flights were delayed between two and twelve hours the onboard meals are half the size of comparablypriced flights and mostly junk drinks cart selection looks like aeroflot in the 80s kenyans are warm and inviting is there a reason why that cannot be the same at kenyatta airport is kenya airways not the major airline of that airport when theres no culture at the top theres no culture on the ground rude immigration officers and security personnel throwing bins at passengers the hotel desk which had no signs was another terrible experience apathetic employees did the minimum required of them passengers already furious to have been delayed prior and now having missed their connections would have to wait till morning to catch the next wrong flight and when you get your hotel sorted youre told the bus will leave very soon but the truth is they wait until enough people cram the bus and only then transfer the passengers to the hotel and everything is done at snail pace with total disregard and matter of fact there are many wonderful and accommodating employees along the way but that is not the point we all tend to remember the negative and unpleasant but the right kind of culture has no room for negative customers have choice and if enough customers stop using kenya airways will that make its point
180,johannesburg to zanzibar via nairobi we booked our flights in feb 2018 from cpt to znz 4 sectors with 12 hours of travel 2 weeks before we flew we checked our flights and the final sector had been cancelled with no kenya airways office in australia i went online and chatted to an agent who quickly solved the issue and rerouted us at the same time reducing 4 sectors to 3 this was all fixed within 10 minutes of chatting on the day of travel everything went smoothly from to check in to boarding the flight was uneventful the service onboard was very good the flight attendants were lovely the food and beverages served were also good the one concern we had was whether or not our bags would arrived at the same time as we did to our surprise all bags for our party of 4 arrive at the same time and destination as us i think we were lucky on the day
181,airobi to new york awful service awful staff avoid this airline at all cost kenya airways is not the pride of africa id say its the shame of africa during the flight from usa to nairobi 14 hours long there was a young man speaking really loud and saying inappropriate things he was disturbing a lot of passengers obviously he was drunk yet he kept ordering alcohol and the staff kept giving him despite several complaints from other passengers including myself the staff of kenya airways did nothing stop him my brother and i had a 21 hours in nairobi kenya airways did not want to pay us a hotel like they did for other customers on the way back home the flight from nairobi to usa the staff was again rude and useless i felt sick and asked for water 5 times before i finally got it save yourself a headache and fly with another airline i wish i read the reviews before spending my money with them i will never fly with them again even if it was free wish i could put 010 as overall rating but the system wont let me
182,our luggage along with everyone else who connected to nairobi from kilimanjaro on 1501218 did not arrive at heathrow leaving us without clothes etc for three days our bags were returned tuesday evening however were in a completely unacceptable state both wheels ripped off as well as the handle we asked for compensation for the damage to the bag and the fact that weve had to buy clothes the customer service team however remained consistently non existent throughout the process calling over 14 times with no response and were yet to hear back regarding our compensation claim three days onward the flight etc was fine just hope that nothing else goes wrong else where as dealing with the customer service at kenyan airways has been completely awful
183,i am waiting here trying to board the flight from entebbe to nairobi its really pathetic that the staff of the handling agent das do not inform passengers on checkin that the flight is delayed while delay information is already in google there is no information updated on the screen and when you approach handling staff for information you have from the google that the flight is delayed they have zero information when the delay announcement is finally made kq offers passengers no respite not even a snack voucher for a delay of more than 4 hours the station manager is nowhere to be seen and since i have already missed my connection they are yet to confirm it they can put me on an alternate flight today until i reach nairobi this has happened to me over and over again i cant promise i wont fly back with them again because in this part of africa this is literally the only option i will tell you this they call themselves pride of africa but its literally shame of africa i dont expect anything to change with this review but at least i can warn people what to expect
184,my brother was to fly from johannesburg to zanzibar but the flight was overbooked and he was scheduled for another flight hotel stay and voucher included next was having to pay 50 for has piece of checkin baggage less than 23kg third was demanding he has an affidavit to fly as he had a one way ticket or they wouldnt give him a boarding pass lastly now that he is in zanzibar the luggage he paid for is missing a simple 6hr journey turned into a 24hr nightmare avoid them they offer very little on ground support and are rude avoid there are better and more value for money options in the african skies nowadays
185,amsterdam to addis ababa via nairobi horrible airline changed my flight significantly for no reason i did not get any support help or compensation on my inbound flight i have to wait 7 hours more on a layover than on my original flight on my outbound flight it is 24 hours in a country where i cannot escape the airport because id need a visa the customer support does absolutely nothing for you if you try to cancel they charge cancellation fees ie 300 ridiculous never book on this airline
186,london to zanzibar via nairobi this airline has degenerated into a mess much talk of its recovery but i am afraid that is not evident please expect to have your flight cancelled and you will be put on a new route of their choosing expect the transfer counter to be manned buy up to 3 people but only one actually working if your flight is not cancelled it will probably be late and you will be lucky to get your bags when you land when you do get your bags days later the list of excuses is endless you will also find some confusion from kenya airways who think they are doing you a favor finding the bag they lost
187,accra to dar es salaam via nairobi we were supposed to be picked up from the airport in dar es salaam by our tour guides and taken straight on a 3day safari we booked and paid for our flights with kenya airways 2 months ago believing kenya airways to be a reliable airline when we arrived 2 hours prior to our flight to check in we were told that the flight was full despite the fact that we had arrived within the requested time to check in and had paid 2 months prior to the flight we were kicked off the flight there were multiple other passengers that also were not able to check in because of too many ticket sales  1 of them had been able to buy a ticket that same morning online despite there obviously not being any left we purchased our tickets 2 months ago  how were there still tickets on sale the same morning and yet we who purchased our tickets 2 whole months ago were kicked off the flight this is unacceptable another had arrived 25 hour prior to departure and had still been kicked off he had also purchased his tickets much later than we had we were out in a hotel for the night with boarding passes printed for the next flight in 24 hours but also with the promise by kenya airways staff that early the next day they would try to find an alternative flight to get us to dar es salaam earlier we were already going to miss our airport pickup who was taking us straight onto a 3day safari for which i had already paid 300 us for we were interrupted during breakfast to rush back to the airport the staff told us we had been booked onto an ethiopian airways flight through addis ababa but they did not have flight details to supply us with they cancelled our tickets for the kenya airways flight that night after a long wait in line the checkin staff found only 1 ticket rather than 2 they couldnt tell us arrival time in dar es salaam but checked in our bags and a long time later gave us boarding passes on checking them we discovered our route would now include a 26hour stopover in addis not only were we leaving a day later than our initial flight but we would be now be arriving 48 hours later  a whole 24 hours later than if we had gone with the later kenya airways flight on showing the staff at kenya airways what they had swapped us over to they then told us the kenya airways flight that night was already full and we couldnt fly seriously this was ridiculous we were made to go back to the hotel and brought back to the airport that evening without any communication as to whether we would even be flying there was no offer of any compensation for the mess made by kenya airways  no upgrade not even an airport lounge no offer of a partial refund not even an apology instead we had a completely wasted day with massive amounts of stuffing around by kenya airways none of it was due to anything that we did wrong all of it was because they overbook their flights to make extra money this airline cant be trusted to get you from a to b
188,on july 2 my wife and i were scheduled to fly nairobi to london on kenya airways then on to the united states on delta i am a us citizen and my wife is a kenyan citizen with a us permanent resident card aka green card all went smoothly until the agent checking paperwork at the gate immediately prior to boarding denied boarding to my wife based on the idea a transit visa was required in the uk when in fact no transit visa is needed for our situation to make matters worse when my wife returned to the ticket counter for further assistance as instructed by the gate agent she was told there was nothing they could do for her and that she would need to purchase an entirely new ticket she purchased a one way ticket on another airline for a sizable sum of course i immediately filed a complaint with kenya airways and insisted on reimbursement after numerous inquiries into the status of my complaint and being told an investigation was ongoing i finally received an email on october 4 in which kenya airways admitted the situation was entirely their fault they offered what amounted to only 20 of the cost of her ticket for compensation after several more emails back and forth ive concluded they will never make things right and accepted their offer its impossible to argue with an airline headquartered in a developing country with no real consequences for appalling customer service their 787 aircraft are nice but i would stay far away from kenya airways you never know what sort of shenanigans they will pull and there is no way to hold them accountable after the fact
189,on the 10th july we were returning from cairo to johannesburg via nairobi flight from nairobi to johannesburg was delayed and this resulted in additional costs been incurred by my family the airline staff were very unhelpful and not interested in the implications caused for us caused by the delay resulting in the subsequent missing of our connecting flight to port elizabeth from johannesburg the representative merely stated that there was nothing he could do and that we had no recourse since the flight to port elizabeth was on a separate ticket and kenya airways contractual obligations ended in jhb at the airport in nairobi while we were seated on the plane it emerged that the pilot had not arrived for work in the end kenya airways asked a pilot from another airline to fly the plane
190,johannesburg to nairobi this airline lost our luggage for 7 days our dream holiday was a disaster could not get hold of any of their baggage handling departments in either johannesburg or nairobi many many emails to customer services all went unreplied according to hotel staff in nairobi this is a very regular occurrence to date we have had no interaction nor an apology from this airline do not fly this airline if you can help it
191,i can only recommend to anyone to avoid this airline i would even pay a bit more just to avoid kenya airways first our flight was canceled and we were given no information as to why the next one went only 24h later during this time they provided us accommodation but only two meals when i asked for a third they declined when i said that i disagree they simply said i could file a complaint to their main office on board our ordered special meals were missing once finally arrived my bag was missing they managed at least to get it to my hotel within 24h when i wanted to introduce compensation claims for the flight and baggage delays they sent me from one office to another up to this date the claims are still pending and i am not sure to get any form of compensation for the stress energy and extra expenses
192,on the 30072018 my 2 year old granddaughter and i were on a return flight from harare to bristol via lusaka nairobi and paris when we arrived in lusaka zambia we were informed that the plane was technically unfit to fly to nairobi this caused an unexpected 6 hour delay in lusaka in lusaka no announcement was given in regards as to what was going to take as a result of this delay we missed our connecting flight in nairobi to france which was at 2300 hrs on the the same day on arrival in nairobi the following morning 31072018 we were informed that the next available flight was available causing in fact a further 15 hour delay in our travel kenya airways booked us on a flight with klm to amsterdam which was a change from paris to bristol in our original itinerary all these delays and changes in our flights was extremely stressful
193,kigali to london via nairobi lost luggage i missed a connecting flight to london due to multiple delays the departure time on the ticket is just a suggestion i and my friend were on 4 different flights and all the flight were delayed which makes me think the issues with my flight was not an isolated or rare incident after missing the flight i asked for my luggage they said they couldnt get it for me but assured me that it would be put on the new kenya airways flight that put me on for the next day on getting to the airport i confirmed 3 times at different stages with the ground staff and they checked or pretended to their computer and confirmed that my luggage was on the flight only to get to heathrow and find out that it was never put on the flight then the nightmare begins their customer service phone doesnt work it passes you through a couple of options and then automatically drops the line online chat doesnt work you get intermittent help on twitter even though they are actively retweeting positive stories about the rubbish airline
194,entebbe to london via nairobi overall a very average experience with staff generally going through the motions medicore food limited drinks and threestar entertainment excellent baggage allowance and quick connecting times make this an acceptable option on the uganda  uk routing if the price is right my headphone socket was broke on the day time nbo  lhr flight which was really disappointing no sparkling water available nor amarula duty free items requested not available and i tried to order in advance which also did not work properly totally full flight london  nairobi departed with a 90 minute delay on the tarmac whilst awaiting atc issues captain welcomed us with a good morning at 7 pm this was slightly disconcerting and gave us very limited information about the delay cabin crew went round with water on one side of the cabin  but not on ours on time arrival into entebbe and luggage out quickly reassuring considering the delay in london making the connection tighter than it should have been a cooked breakfast on either the early morning arrival into nairobi or the 8 am arrival into uganda would have been really welcomed nairobi still a much better transit airport than addis but both carriers way short of the standards set by qatar airways emirates and klm which also compete on this route at good prices
195,johannesburg to accra via nairobi my luggage went missing in nairobi took three days to have my bags arrive in johannesburg when i got my luggage zips were broken locks removed and my some of my stuff were not inside
196,amsterdam to cape town via nairobi it took kenya airways more than 4 days to cancel the flight i had booked for november 2018 because they found that the price was too cheap in their app it is still confirmed i will never fly this airline because they are just not reliable
197,bangkok to guangzhou i am writing to complain the poor services provided kenya airways it is the most disappointed and frustrating journey  according to the flight information the aircraft should have taken off at 300pm in bankkok and arrived in guangzhou at 700 pm on that day however once we checked in we were told that the flight was delayed without detailed reason provided neither ground staff nor cabin crew could confirm the exact boarding time we had been waiting restlessly for more than 5 hours without any notice or compensation that is unacceptable it was until 825 pm that the flight took off which was 5 hours and 25 minutes later than it was supposed to be that ruined our trip on that day in addition during the flight one of passengers sitting behind me kept asking cabin crew for alcohol it astonished me that the cabin crew continued to offer her more alcohol consequently that overlydrunk lady was  out of control singing and laughing loudly it annoyed all the other surrounding passengers and adversely affected the safety of the flight i tried to summon assistance from the crew it surprised me that the crew ignored my call for four times i cannot tolerate such bad behaviour this is the worst flight and airline that i have ever taken i will never choose kenya airways for any single trip in future
198,heathrow to lilongwe via nairobi and  30hours later ther luggage doesnt arrive at the other end the next day i  ring the airport and told  luggage will be on the next flight from heathrow and will arrive in lilongwe and i can collect from there i pay 70 dollars for a cab back to the airport as a single young female to be told your luggage didnt reach lilongwe as it had to stay in nairobi airport as there wasnt any room on the flight not just your bag but 17 others but why this wasnt priority as they didnt get it right the first time  i dont know to be told the next day that you would get a telephone call to arrange pick up of your bag simple right no you arrive at the collection area to pick up your luggage and its looked and because its sun youll have to sit and wait 6459 am still no one and when you go and look for that person who knows you are waiting she is sat having breakfast it is now 5 days later and still no bag the staff have been next to useless except for one kind soul who may or may not deliver watch this space  the latest is they will deliver her bag tonight or tomorrow 67 days after this is not acceptable what is so difficult
199,airobi to cape town via livingstone we took a few days break in livingstone between nairobi and cape town and so experienced two separate kq flights both checkins and boarding processes were smooth and easy  except that on the first flight some passengers were allowed to carry huge quantities of hand luggage on board causing some chaos and frayed tempers the seats were a little narrow on the first flight the breakfast served was expansive with three choices offered in economy class the lunch on the second flight was also good the first crew were rather brusque and unsmiling  but this was made up for by the friendly crew on the second flight which was much less full on both flights the crews served all the food and drinks in a few passthroughs in the first hour and then disappeared until landing the flights operated on time and luggage was quick to appear overall a pleasant experience
200,johannesburg to kilimanjaro via nairobi lets start with the flight out of johannesburg being delayed such that i missed my connection from nairobi to arusha at 630 that evening upon arrival i went to the kenya airways desk to arrange the next flight to arusha they proposed an 1150pm flight this flight actually would stop in zanzibar first thus arriving in arusha at 310 am i was aware of that flight i had to ask if there was an earlier flight  hen and only then did the staff say there is a precision air flight at 1050pm i replied and is that a direct flight she answered yes i then had to connect the dots for the kenya air staff as obviously they are not trained to use common sense or think of their customers at all i politely said  and doesnt kenya airways run precision air at that point the stars aligned and she asked if i would prefer that flight well yes i would prefer getting to my lodge 3 hours earlier as it would be the middle of night it gets better i needed to return a day earlier so my agent called kenya airways on the cost to change  the cost they quoted was more expensive than just going on expedia and buying new tickets from arusha to johannesburg on kenya airways i just went ahead and bought all new tickets home to johannesburg on a different airline never fly them again they failed miserably
201,i was scheduled to fly business class on kenya airways from bangkok to nairobi but unfortunately i had to cancel the flight for business reasons i duly filled the forms for refund got a confirmation from kenya airways on april 11 but no refund was made until now ie almost 2 months later i got in contact with customer service where i was told that they have a backlog and are working on it no date for the refund could be obtained this is very annoying as we are speaking about a substantial amount of money and this means that kenya airways is now on my private black list
202,entebbe to london via nairobi i recently spent some time volunteering in uganda and whilst i was there broke and dislocated my ankle quite badly i needed to return home a few days earlier than planned to undergo surgery so rebooked a flight at additional cost and requested wheelchair assistance upon arrival at entebbe airport they seemed unaware of my situation despite having been informed but did sort out some help i also asked if it would be possible to be upgraded if there were spare seats in business class as it was important to keep my leg which was in a cast elevated as much as possible and particularly during a flight when it may swell more the check in desk confirmed there were seats but that they couldnt upgrade me there but that it should be possible in nairobi where i would change to take an 85hr flight to london at the gate in nairobi i once again asked if it would be possible to sit in business class so i could elevate my leg the man on the desk said that he couldnt do anything without invoicing me but it was his attitude rather than refusal that really annoyed me he was completely unsympathetic laughing at me and treating me as if i was just trying to get some free perks i was clearly in pain and the most annoying thing was that the flight was actually half full as a goodwill gesture hed upgraded me to the seats with more legroom but as i explained to him when he did so that would not help as there was nothing to rest my leg on so it was still dangling down putting pressure on the ankle and causing swelling this seat was also very awkward to get in and out of due to the way the screens came out of the seat from the side and had no additional room to the side as the armrests were fixed however it did provide me with a great view of the business class section which was virtually empty and i was galled to see there were several passengers in economy with at least 4 seats to themselves enabling them to lie down for the entire flight and had they so wished to elevate their leg at no point had the man on the desk mentioned that there were many spare seats which would have enabled me to elevate my leg quite comfortably despite me explaining the issue none of the air hostesses expressed any concern for my situation throughout the flight despite my obvious discomfort and attempts to create a platform from bags and cushions to rest my leg on whilst i understand that other people have paid for the benefit of a business class seat i felt that in extenuating circumstances such as this the airline could have made a goodwill gesture to ensure their passengers wellbeing and comfort i will not be recommending them to others and certainly wont be rushing back to travel with the pride of africa any time soon it topped off a disappointing end to what would have been a fascinating trip but has left a sour taste in my mouth for this particular airline
203,airobi to dubai i would like to commend the crew on a pleasant flight the service was exemplary the cabin staff in our section was courteous and her service good the flight was very smooth  managed to sleep which i find difficult to do in most planes
204,airobi to mombasa checkin was fast and easy and flight boarded and departed on time departure was very rushed and the cabin crew did not perform all the necessary safety checks after takeoff a cold dry croissant was served as breakfast by a very rude flight attendant who would have a go at anyone who asked for anything more than the teacoffeejuice and dry croissant that was available the aircraft cabin could have been cleaner
205,flew kenya airways from nairobi to birmingham via amsterdam the flight was good the cabin crew were great and the food was good however the seat button adjuster ref seat 23j is depressed in the slot hence was unable to adjust my seat and get some sleep hope maintenance can get this sorted sometimes it took too long to clear tables after meals this can be improved
206,airobi to lusaka i travel almost every quarter between lusaka and nairobi and back and my experience is good the crew are courteous and friendly and helpful  one little disappointment though which i have experienced about twice is when the on board duty free shop catalogue indicated there was a special offer of a perfumecologne on sale and when i asked for it i was told it was not available and i also knew i was the first to ask amongst the passengers the product this time on my return trip to lusaka on thursday 29th march was a safari cologne for men by ralph lauren advertised at a special price but no product and no apology in the catalogue
207,i flew the route kinshasa to nairobi march 26 and back march 30 the flighttime is over 3 hours but kenya airways for whatever reason used the embraer 190 which should be used only on short haul flights both times the cabin was full and there was not enough space in the overhead compartments for hand luggage the seats are not comfortable and do not fully recline it was not possible to work as the cabin was too noisy and crowded definitely i will choose ethiopia airlines which uses a boeing 787 for the flight to addis ababa and never kenya airways again
208,a complete disappointment from start to finish delays can happen but they should be communicated properly the 45 min delay turned out to be over 2 hours cabin was untidy and dirty when joining the flight which originated in guangzhou in bangkok the seat was spacious but lacked any privacy dividers or hoods leaving one exposed to the frequent foot traffic walking up and down the cabin all night inflight catering in premier world was mediocre no menu was handed to passengers a cold chicken pie and some vegetarian snack was offered alongside a small chocolate cake after takeoff for this 8h30 overnight flight no appetizer no salad no option of a warm meal just some basic finger food the crew had to be reminded to hand out the amenity kits which contain eyeshades socks ear plugs a pen and toothbrush cabin lights were dimmed but the crew didnt bother to close the curtains between the galley at the second door and the cabin leaving the front section bright and uncomfortable landing in nairobi was 1 hr 20 minutes behind schedule ground staff made little effort to accommodate connecting passengers who missed their connection overall an underwhelming experience for the same or lower price i would rather take in the 2 hour or so connection timw in doha dubai or abu dhabi and fly with an airline which takes onboard service and passenger comfort seriously
209,entebbe to mumbai via nairobi connecting on jet airways to colombo the ground staff was acting completely arbitrarily and each of them had different rules our main problem with kenya airways was not on board but with the ground staff my husband ugandan and i german were booked on a flight to colombo in sri lanka it was a oneway ticket since the sri lankan visa is only for 30 days i had another flight booked with malaysian airlines to cambodia within that period my husband and i both had evisas for sri lanka so when we came to entebbe airport the kenya airways lady at the checkin counter didnt let us board the airplane she claimed that ugandan citizens werent allowed to go to sri lanka on an evisa our evisa was already granted and even certified by the sri lankan embassy in kampala also she said that we had to have a flight from sri lanka back to our home countries and she couldnt let us go there on a oneway ticket when i told her about our outbound flight with malaysian she said that there is a rule that every person has to return to their home countries within one year so we had to show her a ticket back to our home countries otherwhise she wouldnt check us in as i said she was acting totally arbitrarily unbelievable so in the end i had to book a flight for each of us back to our home countries which i of cause cancelled immediatly once arrived in colombo i did it right there and then at the airport but she still had the opinion that our evisas werent ok so we missed the flight then the lady took us to the kenya airways office at the airport and looked for another flight for us but since it was our mistake that we missed it we had to pay for the change fees she then told us to go to the sri lankan high comission in kampala the next morning and apply for the normal visa in general this lady was very rude when i tried to explain to her that our evisas were already approved etc she told me to shut up and that she was tired of dealing with people like us so when we went to the embassy we talked to the ambassador personally and he was completely shocked that they wouldnt let us board the airplane since ugandan citizens can go to sri lanka on an evisa and ours was already approved he gave us his personal number so that we could call im in case we would have any problems again the next day the checkin lady wasnt there and we had no problems to board the airplane even though our visa was still the same and no one asked us for return tickets to our home countries when i sent a customer complaint to the kenya airways customer service they answered me that they received it and would forward it to someone from the customer service team but after that i didnt receive a reply for 1 month so just recently i emailed them again saying that i am still waiting for a reply but nothing happend i am deeply disappointed this was my first experience with kenya airways and it was the worst thing that ever happened to me in terms of flying never ever did i experience something like that with any other airline i lost a lot of money and i didnt even receive an apologetic message from them not even talking about compensation for the inconvenience i would never recommend this airline to anyone dont fly with kenya airways if you dont want to have incidents like this just save your time money and energy and fly with other airlines like qatar or emirates
210,airobi to kisumu domestic kenya airways is surprisingly good i figured out the reason why big shots travel these routes together with tourists so these are the folks that can cause trouble for management if it is not together service check in safari lounge snacksdrinks are served on very short haul flights seamless check in service with delta airlines elite medallion members is a excellent service kenya airways offers on odd thing is if you are connecting in nairobi to a domestic destination you have to exit the domestic area then recheck everything again for your onwards domestic connection which adds to the hassle
211,airobi to amsterdam the flight and boarding process for kenya airways was seamless being a platinum member kenya airways is very good at recognizing status even at the safari lounge i admit the new terminal gates are rather confusing in numbering however  the meals etc were acceptable flight attendants were good too while not at the standards of the game lodges and many restaurants in the country in terms of wait service they were fine the big issue with me was the seats they were extremely uncomfortable in economy even with a neck pillow the seats were hard and cramped this will become a challenge for passengers on their soon to start nonstop to new york sitting 155 hours on these seats would not  be something i would do would rather prefer the connection an odd thing happened when we arrived at amsterdam the flight was met by armed dutch state police going through kenyan passports with microscopes a testament to how useless the kenya passports are nowadays due to the rampant corruption from kenyan immigration
212,london heathrow to nairobi i rang kenya airways office in london at about 8 pm to book a ticket for my 15 year old daughter to travel to nairobi the lady told me they dont take payment by phone she needed to fax me a form to complete and return with bank details i told her i have never seen a facsimile machine for over 15 years she said she could not help if i had no access to fax machine i rang 30 minutes later and a man answered quoted me a little lower price for the same travel days and was ready to take payment on phone and do the reservation i told him i will call in ten minutes since i did not have my card ready after 10 minutes another lady answered and quoted me a fare 200 higher when i mentioned that i had been quoted a different fare just a few minutes before and wanted to speak to the guy she said she did not know where he was i rang first thing the following day and another lady did the booking by phone within a few minutes at a much lower fare without haggling the issue of fax machine did not arise and i wondered if each person on shift had their own rules i am aware fare prices change but how they fluctuate upwards and downwards within minutes by margins of over 200 for the same daytime of travel is unbelivable
213,i will never fly with kenya airways again or a heads up for anyone who is daft enough to fly kenya airways they call themselves the pride of africa i would like to challenge that and say they are the hustlers of africa they have left me stranded in kenya with half my family on the flight and put a suspension on the last leg of my flight due to me missing one leg of my domestic internal flights even though i have fairly paid for all my seats on all the connecting flights speaking of the unhelpful customer services i spent 30 mins on the phone only to be placed on hold and eventually cut off with the issue unresolved i then decided to go to the main office in nairobi in hopes that something could be appeased only to find out that my only option is to book a new flight my primary advice would be never to fly with kenya airways they have such nonsensical and unfair policies if you are forced to fly kenya airways remember to take all your connecting flights and if you miss it for any unfortunate circumstance notify the airlines
214,mombasa to guangzhou via nairobi the boeing 787 is a  must try service on long range routes and they have great inflight service i only got confused at the number of times cabin crew changed but still great good food great sleeper seat i would fly again  only let down ground crew especially in guangzhou and mombasa difficult people
215,we arrived in dubai and searched for our baggage for 2 hours got sent from pillar to post until we were eventually sent to the baggage claims dept only to be told there wasnt enough time to put our baggage 4 suitcases on the plane in nairobi so it was left behind but it would arrive the following day at 130 am 20 hours later the result one whole day wasted at departure in cape town we were told they had no fragile stickers my husband and i were put in separate seating areas despite purchasing the tickets simultaneously using one card they managed to sort that out as we boardedthe plane was old and dirty too the mistake and lack of acknowledgement is 930 aed and 20 hours wasted eventually we got hold of the kenya airways office at dubai airport who organized with emirates to bring our suitcases with their next flight which lands at 1030 tonight so here we wait i will never recommend kenya to any of our expat friends who travel this flight on a regular basis
216,dakar to johannesburg via nairobi a colleague and i were booked to travel from dakar to nairobi and from nairobi to johannesburg the point of taking this route was to get to johannesburg before noon on saturday 9th in order to attend to other commitments there kenya airways seemed the most convenient for our requirements there was a two hour plus gap between the scheduled arrival time of kq513 and the departure time of kq760  so none of us could have imagined the nightmare that awaited us at the kenya airways hub in nairobi  due to a 2hour 15 minute or longer delay of the departure of kq513 from dakar we barely made it on time for our connecting flight there was no ground staff available to assist us get to the connecting flight the ground staff at the gate were quick to gleefully tell us that we had been offloaded from flight kq760 to johannesburg  they were there to block not to facilitate passengers following desperate pleas they decided to board the business class passengers and not economy class  thus separating my colleague and i when i pleaded on my colleagues behalf i was told that not enough meals were loaded into the economy class cabin if passengers are late due to a kenyan airways delay and no fault of their own ground staff should meet the passengers and escort them to the connecting flight if it is still on the ground in the event that the flight is overbooked tell passengers the truth than use an excuse as pathetic as the one that was given by ground staff
217,johannesburg to addis ababa via nairobi upon arrival in addis ababa i collected my suitcase  only to find that it had been terribly damaged whats more is that i paid extra to have the bag wrapped in south africa i immediately went to the baggage help desk where i was given a reference number and told that i would be contacted for the entire stay in ethiopia i was not contacted by kenya airways when i returned to south africa i emailed the airline asking for an update i was referred to someone else and have still not been helped truly disappointed in this bad service

219,we travelled business class from london to cape town via nairobi and kenya airways lost our bags we have spent our entire last 2 days trying to get this sorted with kenya airways and the customer service representatives cannot be bothered we have been directed round and around in circles never would we pay to fly with them again
220,dar es salaam to bangkok via nairobi i had the worst experience with kenya airways my flight got canceled for 7hrs they provided us with accommodation in nairobi however one of the staff at the airport in nairobi told me kenya airways isnt responsible for my ticket from bangkok to phuket  because it was domestic flight i was meant to use thai airways  it was their fault that my ticket from bangkok to phuket went to waste yet they told me i have to pay for my own expenses  i am more than disappointed with this flight i wont recommend to use it if you have a connecting flight from nairobi they do not take responsibility when it comes to such big matters
221,review   mumbai to khartoum via nairobi kenya airways is not bad flights are in time but found some cabin crew not fully experienced food and beverages are acceptable but lack of option and choice of service for the last seated passengers inflight entertainment is okay but not updated
222,review   nairobi to amsterdam the announcement about boarding times were clear during the waiting period boarding gates opened early enough it was easy to locate the gates as the airport is clearly marked and well lit the boeing b7878 is new even though the seat i had was somehow uncomfortable but with adequate leg room nevertheless the cabin crew were quite welcoming and wore a welcoming smile the aircraft left on time once airborne we were served snacks then a tasty meal followed including options of drinks no sooner had we settled for a nab another round of snacks came along then a meal it was an endless supply of food by an efficient cabin crew we landed at amsterdam on time  i recommend this airline
223,review   dar es salaam to bangkok via nairobi it is obvious why this airline is in deep financial trouble none of the payment methods on their website work  we tried several different credit cards from different banks from accounts in different countries including east africa and none of them worked flights need to be paid for with an additional fee  they will not waive it even though their website has payment issues over the phone or through thirdparty websites we needed to change our business class tickets to the next day due to unforseeable changes although their website says you can do this online you cant again it wouldnt take any payment method even when we did a 3 way call between our banks and the airline their solution was to write an email to their tech department all of the flight options the website showed were different from what the kenya airways representative could see on their end all of the flight options the representative could see were hundreds of dollars more than what was being shown to us on their website after several hours 12pm until 7pm and dropped calls later they finally booked us a ticket that ended up costing us significantly more and we ended up losing our business class seats we couldnt pay over the phone and so we were told we could pay at the airport at no extra charge upon reaching the airport the ticketing agent charged us even more than the price on the emailed ticked we had she refused to call the manager and told us we could either pay the extra money or not get on the flight once finally reaching our destination we tried reaching out to kenya airways several times to share our poor experience hoping they would do something about it to avoid losing our business in the future as we fly into east africa often to vist family  friends instead we were met with a generic email replies telling us they were looking into the situation this airline and their customer service is a disappointment unfortunately they have a monopoly over the east african region offering the only choice to fly between major cities if you are flying into the area from outside of east africa there are plenty of other airlines based in the middle east south africa and other continents which are far more reputable
224,review   zanzibar to johannesburg via nairobi we were told that due to overbooking we must take a later flight about 4 hours they always overbook a flight so we were the unlucky ones who have to take a flight four hours later with zero consideration for the inconvenience caused there will be no compensation as they booked us on saa this again was our fault we insisted on lunch which was a burger only because kenyan airways policy does not buy sides we were informed our luggage was on the saa flight after 30 minutes of waiting we realised that our luggage has not arrived with us after numerous queries we managed to locate our luggage thanks to helpful staff at or tambo as the lady at the counter said that we must actually be thankful that our luggage has arrived the staff at kenyan airways was unhelpful and made as though everything was our fault i will never fly kenya airways again
225,review   london to dar es salaam via nairobi heathrow to nairobi was full had an aisle seat but cushion was well worn evening meal served by efficient cabin crew meal and breakfast was better than on some better known airlines nairobi to dar es salaam on embraer 190 was a pleasant flight comfortable leather seats and another breakfast flight was on time return flight from dar es salaam scheduled for 345 am which was a bit inconvenient but get to the departure gate in good time  this flight left 15 minutes early as all passengers had boarded aircraft was clean breakfast was served cabin crew efficient at nairobi there is a scheduled 4 hour wait for the flight to heathrow again aircraft was on time and nearly full yet another breakfast this time a full meal with three choices  omelette sausage or vegetarian cabin crew efficient and worked smoothly and without fuss had an aisle seat next to the exit door plenty of legroom and a comfortable flight maybe they could have done a couple of water runs as it is a long flight arrived on time but had to stack as airport was busy i have used kenya airways before this year they are worth considering and are a cut above some of the uk competitors in terms of food and comfort
226,review   dar es salaam to mahe via nairobi at a very reasonable price i was surprised and a little nervous that my connection in nairobi was only 50 minutes  what could possibly go wrong  but on the day everything went like clockwork the first flight was in an embraer very comfortable and even had usb ports nice light breakfast served magnificent views of kilimanjaro on this route left side but i imagine this could vary departed and arrived on time found my new gate relatively easily and with plenty of time to explore the severely overpriced airport food outlets not that i needed to eat the next flight provided lunch which was tasty full selection of movies on this flight also all round an excellent experience
227,review   london to nairobi the aircraft was a fairly new boeing 787 i cannot fault the crew aircraft cleanliness seat comfort and pitch all were fine on an economy cabin flight  my onboard entertainment system did not function on either the outbound or inbound flights on the london nairobi flights the sound accompanying films was inaudible on both the airline provided headsets and my noise cancelling headphones this is a problem experienced by at least 30 passengers on each flight and anecdotally according to another passenger a common problem on their flights
228,review   nairobi to paris we were in the lounge when an announcement was made the flight was delayed the next thing we knew we were called to final boarding arrived at the gate to confusion once we were boarded the confusion continued lots of chatting among staff at the doors for about 20 minutes during that time there was no attempt to serve the business class passengers it was a long flight no water bottles provided which is fine because we like to try and keep things environmentally friendly but also had to ask repeatedly for glasses of water had to help ourselves to pillows and blankets from a bin they ran out of 2 of the 3 choices of breakfast by row 4 in business class the usb charger in my seat didnt work my headphones made a loud screeching noise if i turned my head my seat wouldnt fully recline during take off and landing our attendant kicked off her shoes and slept she was probably the only one on the flight that did catch a comfortable sleep weve flown business class often and if we ever are forced to fly kenya air again well choose economy class because it felt like that anyway
229,review   nairobi to dar es salaam this airline is in deep financial crisis and flights are unreliable airline management and customer service is very poor quality the aircraft seem to be in reasonable condition and the crew also seem ok the problem is the rest of it prices are high unfortunately the more or less have a regional monopoly so those of us who are forced to use them frequently have expensive frustrations when there is a problem they are simply not interested if you have a choice choose the alternative
230,review   we bought a return flight between guangzhou and nairobi while from guangzhou to nairobi is via hanoi and from nairobi to guangzhou is via bangkok when we were checking in just now for our flight back to guangzhou we confirmed our destination with the staff but they still gave us boarding passes which said from nairobi to bangkok but for my asking the airline desk later when we got into the waiting area we wouldnt even know that we still need boarding passes from bangkok to guangzhou and things would be even more troublesome if i hadnt asked never seen a via flight that requires 2 boarding passes for a person each for a sector of the flight when we flew from guangzhou to nairobi it was only one boarding pass per person more bizarrely we are placed in different seats these two sectors which means we will still have to change seats when we arrive in bangkok moreover flight service is mediocre avoid at all cost
231,review   johannesburg to bangkok via nairobi  johannesburg to nairobi the staff were rude and you felt like you were the one being inconsiderate when asking for any help the flight was ok just the cabin crew were unfriendly and unapproachable the second flight was from nairobi to bangkok and experienced the same issues with the cabin crew except this time after pressing for assistance as they missed us for documentation that needed filling they never came so i pressed for assistance again and no one came  so clicked it again and a flight attendant came storming down the isle and yelled at us to the point where we could not speak because she was busy telling us off for clicking the button more then once two horrible encounters with kenya airways and would not recommend this airline
232,review   took a flight from johannesburg to london via nairobi and a return from amsterdam to johannesburg via nairobi i was pleasantly surprised by the airline and staff members all flights departed ontime and arrivals were ahead of schedule what the airline lacked was made up for by helpful crew members i would fly with the airline again
233,review   johannesburg  nairobi  johannesburg outbound 25 june 2017 inbound 1 july 2017 was on b7878 for the first time very nice aircraft indeed and great leg room fas were great on both routes on the outbound flight before we left the terminal we were served water and soda and towels snacks served as soon as the seat belt were off and lunch not long after the fas were very busy the whole flight approx 330 hrs return was much the same food was average airline but edible entertainment not fantastic but suitable for this flight this is the second time i have used kenya airways and they are really very good will recommend
234,review   hanoi to johannesburg via nairobi we had the misfortune of experiencing the pride of africa on our honeymoon to vietnam in april 2017 our negative and unpleasant experience with kenya airways culminated in the loss of my wifes luggage upon arrival in johannesburg after numerous phone calls and emails absolutely nothing was done to locate this luggage and eventually the airline merely admitted that it was untraceable none of our calls were ever returned we received differing stories of the bag not being loaded first in hanoi and then in nairobi it became quite obvious from the outset that the airline did not care about this problem and could not be bothered to help us the flight experience was unprofessional tardy and disrespectful towards the passengers traveling between hanoi and nairobi felt like the passengers were alone on the flight and when the air hostess staff were visible they were sullen impatient and obviously cared very little for the wellbeing and comfort of the passengers on board upon boarding the flight in hanoi we were not greeted by a single staff member passengers were sleeping in incorrect seats and no air hostess could be found to assist us food was served with an air of contempt and annoyance the hot breakfast consisted of a stale croissant and fruit drinks were served once on the flight trays took more than an hour to be cleared an all round ghastly experience hopefully not to ever be repeated we arrived home from an amazing honeymoon with a bitter taste in our mouths and one less bag stay away  not worth the lower cost at all
235,review   lubumbashi to nairobi as bad as lubumbashi is as airport as great was the service by the kenya airways ground crew i could check my baggage all the way through to zurich and received all boarding passes even as i switched from skyteam to star alliance the whole check in procedure took only 5 minutes the flight was very good with comfortable seats good food and great red wine staff was super friendly
236,review   amsterdam to johannesburg via nairobi clean airplanes welcoming crew departures on time service onboard was efficient and friendly catering just enough portions rather small but tasteful inflight entertainment poor as well as the quality and availability of working headsets good first experience though still not to compare with the middle east carriers
237,review   johannesburg to mombasa via nairobi due to technical issues with the original airline we were rebooked on kenya airways boeing 787 was in in mint condition warmly welcomed by the purser and shown to our seats the business class is called premium world and seats in a 222 configuration with fully reclining seats offered a welcome drink and introduced to staff who would look after us personally warm towels followed by a review of the menu and wine list by the stewardess flight left on time and was smooth seat was comfortable and i managed a good hour nap laying flat luncheon included an amuse bouche followed by a salad and two options for main i opted for the steak which was slightly over done but still yummy my fellow traveller tasted the wines and he loved the selection of south african wines the service was personal friendly and warm not too much or too fawning the kenyan coffee was a lovely surprise my one complaint is that the in flight entertainment isnt up to the level of emirates but i have encountered few airlines that have matched that landing on time and we had priority lane through immigration shorter flight was on an embraer e190 first time flying this aircraft and what a little delight similar warm service with good humour definitely recommend
238,review   despite a 25hour delay due to technical issues the flight went on fine a wide variety of food options were available and the food was average seats were comfortable with excellent recline and large comfy blankets are provided for sleeping the bathroom at the front of the aircraft is quite small and cramped offering no additional features compared to the bathrooms in economy in fact the bathrooms in economy are more spacious cabin lights are practically turned off overnight allowing for a good nights sleep there is a tv screen tray table and power socket in the armrest tv screen is nice and large noise cancelling headphones are provided i found them rather comfortable and i have a fairly large head and wear glasses the selection of inflight tv programs is average passengers in business class are treated fairly well an amenity kit is given which contains a toothbrush socks a pen a comb and an eye mask which is nice hot towels are provided at certain points during the flight including upon boarding the lounge at nairobi is also quite good kenya airways has a very nice layout of the airport for business class passengers i had no queues a very smooth process overall a nice experience wouldve been excellent if technical issues were diagnosed before the flight to avoid delays and i do hope kq improves its ontime performance
239,review   my kenya airways flight from nairobi to paris a codeshare with air france was delayed and eventually left 14 h after the scheduled time we had to queue for almost an hour at 130 am to get a voucher for a taxi as they were all written by hand and we were not given a hotel voucher just told to go to a hotel which very kindly took us in based on our word that our flight was delayed we did not collect our luggage we were told by kq staff at the airport that we would be collected at 11 am the following day the next morning i looked at my booking on the internet to see that the plane was scheduled to leave at 11 am i took a taxi to the airport from the city and when i checked in i was told that the plane was leaving at 11 am i got the same message at the boarding gate where they were getting ready to accept passengers the airport staff seemed not to be aware that there were 200 passengers in hotels in nairobi we had to wait for them to arrive we were then told to go to gate 13 but the plane was at gate 14 we left 14 hours late kenya airways staff made no public announcements during the whole of this shambles and no apology was given until we heard from the pilot that passengers had to be collected from nairobi the staff at the gate seemed leaderless and unable to communicate with the many anxious passengers who had missed their connecting flights and would not arrive in paris until 9 pm too late to get anywhere i had to pay for a hotel in paris and then continue my journey by train the next day
240,review  djibouti to antananarivo via nairobi my last 6 flights with kenya airways i have had 5 delays in the span of 2 months thats unacceptable and unprofessional what is more they dont communicate with their clients out of total disrespect has the pride of africa become the shame of africa time will tell but at this pace i am going to see somewhere else and get Ã  at least a bit of respect with my money
241,review   flew the day flight kenya airways from nairobi to amsterdam in the new boeing 787 and i am really not impressed the 787 is certainly an improvement in comfort and reduce negative effects of flying but the business class of kenya airways is just no match for the price which is 40 more than competition all in the service is just behind lie flat seat is ok but already look old after couple of years and the conception is already ancient manual handset with a wire service is just too basic for the price you pay and the staff is pretty cold unattentive and seem bored every time you ask something not all of them there are couple of pursers really doing it right but the rest is awful i am not asking much as flying is a commodity but a minimum of politeness when coughing up 5000 usd for a 7h flight is a fare expectations as the level of service is nowhere representative of that premium economy in some european carriers is actually better service for 13 of the fare meal service is quite basic you get the plates and in 5 min they are taken out the cabin is ok but already looks old nothing like you should expect in light of the fares charged on this route and the contrast with klm is just obvious
242,review   bangkok to nairobi and i was very impressed with them i was taking a school group to africa and originally was trying to fly ethiopian or qatar but both were booked out so we went with kenya airways we were met at suvarnabhumi airport by an agent of the airline as we were a group and checkin was very smooth their boeing 787 seems to have more pitch than others i have flown and so was much more comfortable for me with longer legs on an overnight flight flight crew to nairobi were all african i specify this as the nairobi to bangkok return flight they were all asian as the flight continues to hong kong and were very professional and provided good service as the flight originated in china most passengers on board when we boarded were chinese and so were typically noisy during the flight but no more than i have gotten used to food was good and served punctually i even slept a bit during the flight  unusual for me overall i recommend them as a cheaper flight to africa
243,review   london heathrow to nairobi the inbound aircraft from nairobi was late into heathrow we had to briefly go back to the gate with a maintenance issue one of my reading lights didnt work but these things happen with airlines the crew was great the cabin was spotless and meal delicious they held the connecting flight to mombasa for me something that airlines promise but rarely do that flight had a newish aircraft charming crew and clear flight deck announcements they served a warm breakfast not bad for a 45 minute flight kq were equally good on a flight to london a couple of years ago after i slipped a disc and had to be taken home in a wheelchair i was looked after perfectly until i reached heathrow my only criticism is the fault of kenya airports authority it is unbelievable in the 21st century that to get to jkias domestic terminal you have to push your heavy luggage cart across an enormous car park with kerbs busy traffic and dubious individuals who want to relieve you of your luggage temporarily  or perhaps permanently there is no reason not to have a level paved lit signposted pathway  after all if kenya can get chinese contractors to finish a brand new railway line between mombasa and nairobi with gleaming new stations and viaducts six months early they cant prevail on the chinese to build a simple path in a week  if the work is too onerous to do themselves that is or would that deprive freelance porters of income the car park trek is a huge disincentive to use kq to domestic destinations in kenya  its easier but not such a pleasant experience to use turkish or ethiopian which fly direct and clear customs at your destination
244,review   nairobi to mt kilimanjaro we arrived in nairobi with some lateness from our ba flight and had to transfer to our kenya airways flight to mt kilimanjaro since our luggage was not checked through we were told we should proceed to immigration collect our luggage then check into our kenya airways flight the minute we arrived with lateness we asked some official in the airport where to go they pointed us towards the connections area up some stairway we proceeded to the kenya airways desk the staff were a bit clueless as to what to do until we were told to go to another desk who in turn told us to talk to ba after bouncing around a few desks running we knew we were not going to make our flight and our luggage would be left in the collection belt we decided to miss the flight and try for a later one the kenya airways staff were absolutely unhelpful when trying to purchase the tickets we were sent to another desk guess what they dont take cards and the tickets were 320 each at this desk we were finally told the only way to sort this was to go through immigration collect our luggage go to the other terminal to another kenya airways desk buy our tickets then check in in my lifetime of travelling this was one of the most gruelling and awful experiences i have ever had after collecting our luggage and walking outside being accosted by random officials trying to make a quick buck and people trying to scam us we made our way to the kenya airways office they then offered us a pair of tickets which were now 420 each apparently our no show on the flight we missed incurred a fee they were taking advantage of the situation despite none of this being our fault and only due to their incompetence we had no choice but to buy the tickets and move on we checked in and made the flight which was going via zanzibar which finally got us to mt kilimanjaro at 3am it is an awful airport countless security checks unhelpful and incompetent staff never again
245,review   i am back to say a big thank you to kenya airways i traveled from moshoeshoe airport in lesotho on feb 12 2017 by maluti sky that flight was delayed and i had a very short time for international transfer at or tambo not surprisingly my luggage which had been checked to johannesburg was left behind i barely made it through checkin in time for my flight kq761 to jkia the support i received from kq staff was amazing starting at or tambo kq counter i was whisked through checkin and i made it for my flight then a staff member picked up my issue with left luggage and personally ensured that it was not only loaded on the next flight but i was sent a confirmation via whatsapp on reporting the left luggage at the jkia complaints desk another staff member was very helpful and logged the complaint calling to inform me that the luggage had been received in nairobi there were many others who pointed me in the right direction to ensure that i got back my bag intact and without any drama the entire crew on board kq761 from or tambo to jkia on feb 12 2017 provided an excellent cabin service and a smooth ride
246,review   nairobi to johannesburg on kq760 the flight was on time checkin was smooth with very friendly staff at checkin the flight was  smooth and incabin service and entertainment was great we touched down in joburg with minutes to spare this was refreshing since i had a bad experience in july 2016 with kenya airways flew to entebbe then got delayed for hours and my luggage was left behind this is great improvement
247,review   this has to be one of the worst travel experiences ever i would never recommend kenya airways they changed our departure date by 1 day from maputo to amsterdam via nairobi without even advising us this meant i had to change my ongoing flights to toulouse and belfast as i had booked and paid easyjet for these kenya airways refuse to reimburse me the cost of changing the tickets then when we went to check in at maputo airport and were told that our tickets had been cancelled and we were not on the flight that was a very stressful 30 minutes finally they advised us that we could check in the boeing 787 from amsterdam to nairobi was terrible poor choice of movies very cramped terrible cold breakfast tasteless dinner the only enjoyable bit about the whole experience was the flight from nairobi to amsterdam that was operated by klm even nairobi airport is a terrible place poor choice of restaurants no airconditioning and no wireless never again
248,review   johannesburg to bangkok via nairobi terrible airline  do not book kenya airways we originally booked our johannesburg to bangkok tickets via nairobi because of the short travelling time  there was only a 115 hour layover in nairobi each way months after booking the ticket kenya airways rescheduled our flights so that there was a 7 hour layover in nairobi the 7 hour layover ended up 5 hours longer than expected because the flight to bangkok was severely delayed this after our flight to nairobi had been delayed by 2 hours and used a different aircraft that did not have in flight entertainment the 5 hour delay severely impacted our plans in thailand creating great inconvenience and forcing us to make additional travel arrangement to the island we were staying on at our own expense when we raised these concerns with the kenya airways service desk at nairobi airport we were told that they could not assist us and we had to log a complaint with kenya airways customer service my partner logged a complaint  we have still had no reply to this we faced the same experience on our return flights  the flight from bangkok to nairobi was delayed by 3 hours which meant we missed our connecting flight to johannesburg and were put on the next flight out  another 7 hour wait at nairobi airport then we were notified that we had been moved to a later flight that evening because a smaller aircraft had to be used when we eventually arrived back in johannesburg my partners bag had been left in nairobi the agent at the kenya airways luggage desk told us it would be couriered to us the next morning  it was only delivered at 10pm the next night our flights with kenya airways ended up being the worst travel experience of any airline  we ended up spending over 20 hours extra at nairobi airport as well as 5 hours extra at johannesburg and bangkok airports due to kq delays  an entire day of our holiday lost due to their inefficiencies none of the customer service complaints we have logged have been replied to we will never fly kenya airways again
249,review   a few hours before departing from johannesburg to bujumbura via nairobi we have been informed that our flight was delayed for 8 hours which caused us to extend our hotel stay and delay our car rental at airport we are issued with 2 boarding pass jnbnbo and nbobjm in nairobi we are waiting at our gat to board flight also delayed for 4 hours when finally boarding the attendant informed us that this flight doesnt go to bujumbura anymore but to kigali nobody informed us of the change despite our visit to the helpdesk to ask information about food and drink voucher which was not given calling the operation manager we have been told that the decision has been made a few hours before our boarding time  needless to say we were not given any compensation whatsoever  the flight crew were very nice and aircraft and seats comfortable and that is the reason i give it 3 points in my rating kenya airways wont see me again
250,review   london heathrow to cape town via nairobi flights were as expected pretty basic economy class with a 12 hour overnight wait for connection in nairobi on the return leg which was awful it was cheap but i would never fly with kenya airways again due to their terrible customer service my fiance left an item not on display in the seat pocket in front of her she realised as soon as she left the plane and staff on board were contacted within 30 minutes of us getting into the terminal the item had mysteriously disappeared during cleaning i followed up with their customer service by phone said they would investigate but never called me back and then by email i know it was our fault for leaving the item but i would have expected them to at least be helpful in dealing with our enquiry or show some sympathy or some kind of apology instead they said that there was no evidence that i brought the item onboard therefore they could not do anything to help no form that i could fill in for lost items no documentation for an insurance claim just a short rude reply from their customer services which made me think that this was not the first time that this had happened and that i should make other potential kenya airways customers aware of this  if you leave something of value on the plane in nairobi dont expect to get it back
251,review   lusaka to bangkok via nairobi the initial kenya airways flight from lusaka to nairobi was delayed and i was told that the connecting flight would be delayed by 2 hours which ensured connection time for the connecting flight upon arriving in nairobi i was informed that the connecting flight kq886 would not depart nairobi at 0200am but  it would depart at 0900am again this kq886 flight has been delayed i am now told that this flight will not be available for 4 days and i will have to wait in nairobi i am now informed by the airline customer service personnel that the flight will depart on december 30th at 1159pm at this point i have no idea if i will be on this flight if this flight even exists i am so upset by the poor service and rude customer service personnel to make matters worse i have other travel arrangements and bookings that have to be rescheduled some of which are nonrefundable ground transportation changes to be made and no idea at all from kenya airways management and customer service personnel when i will arrive at my destination i have spoked to several customer service personnel and airline supervisors and managers all of which provide different excuses for the airlines disfunctionality and various excuses as to why the flight is delayed and when it will be rescheduled what a terrible terrible experience i cannot believe that there is such disfunctionality with in this international airline the lack of customer support and the over all disrespect for its customers
252,review   johannesburg to zanzibar via nairobi worst airline that i have encountered flight from johannesburg to nairobi delayed by 15 hours we ended up flying at 3am no drinks were offered prior to the descent which was at about 8 am about 20 of us missed our connecting flight to zanzibar because only 1 hour had been allowed between flights others missed flights to kilimanjaro kenya airways provided a hotel in a terrible area for our 10 hour layover there was nothing to do near the hotel and most of us missed a full day at expensive resort accommodation in zanzibar we would only reach our hotels at around 10 pm
253,review   johannesburg to bangkok via nairobi terrible experience with kenya airways losing my baggage and not being able to assist in any way to track the baggage very poor assistance when calling the helpdesk in kenya and staff kept putting me hold with no answers i would not recommend flying kenya airways if you are having to relocate and need your check in luggage urgently
254,four short flight with kenya airways two on time and two delayed by 45 odd minutes all fairly comfortable notably the e190 poor breakfast on the red eye from lilongwe to nairobi small snack on the 40 minute leg to and from mombasa and reasonable lunch with wine on the return to lilongwe from nairobi ground staff and flight crew were reasonable efficient and friendly given the short flights award flights so good value
255,johannesburg to antananarivo via nairobi with kenya airways generally positive experience with kq on 4 sectors dreamliner is excellent and the e190 also has personal tv screens one sector they were not functional food sometimes excellent chicken and beef sometimes really bad fish and vegetarian cabin crew consistently excellent and beverage services generous kq offers 2 x 23kg bags to madagascar unlike all their competitors flying the route but the kq agents admitted the smaller planes that use the route e190 cannot cope with the loads when the flight is full which ours were which resulted in ours and many others bags not making it from nbo  although it followed the following day we were disappointed that they were not able to deliver to our hotel we had to return back to the airport and wait for hours for the bags to be released last flight nbo  jnb involved flying through an electrical storm for a full 30 minutes in the middle of the night the crew handled it brilliantly
256,amsterdam to lilongwe via nairobi boarding was smooth with the gate open for nearly an hour and manned by klm staff the extra leg room seat was fairly comfortable but narrow drinks and a pretty minimal meal were served by friendly crew i slept through breakfast but missed little as it really was small departure on time and arrival early flight was full the second shorter flight to lilongwe was in an e190 and was more pleasant with a cooked breakfast and more space
257,review   london heathrow to lusaka via nairobi with kenya airways outward boeing 787 full aircraft seats narrow and not much room to move particularly in terms of width on time departure cabin clean and cabin attendants efficient food was average with a choice landed on time at nairobi then off again to lusaka again on time embraer 190 leather seats but seen some wear plane fairly full snack served on short flight return flight from lusaka  this time via harare to pick up more passengers  had to stay on the plane embraer 190 while cabin was cleaned return flight was late as was departure from harare back to nairobi but enough time to connect with boeing 787 to london again food was average cabin crew were ok but rather expressionless dreamliner is not a comfortable plane and the tinted windows were irritating as the centre seats were virtually dark when window passengers used the dark tint and i could hardly see my food although a newish aircraft seat pocket was torn and plane looked grubby arrival at heathrow was a little late overall impression was satisfactory in that this type of airline does its best to survive amongst the bigger ones
258,review   djibouti to zanzibar via niarobi some friends and i decided to take a short trip to zanzibar over an extended weekend for about four days unfortunately more than 13 of our trip ended up being spent in transit i am thoroughly disappointed by the lack of professionalism and competence repeatedly displayed by the kenya airway agents in the nairobi airport the first flight to nairobi was more than an hour late when we arrived in nairobi we immediately went to the kenyan airways counter knowing we had missed our connection the attendant at the counter told us there were not any other flights that would get us into zanzibar that day and the only one available left close to midnight and we would arrive the next morning this was a lie we waited a bit and went to another desk and the person there found a flight leaving that evening and though we still spent more than 12 hours in the airport it would get us into zanzibar about 11 pm when leaving the airport from zanzibar on the return flight sept 4 the personnel at the counter precision air would not print both our boarding passes they told us we had to get them at the desk in nairobi we had a 1 hr and 15 min layover and immediately went to the desk to get our tickets of course the queue was very long and half the customers ignored it and walked right up to the desk  which the kenya airline employees did not seem to care about when the first of our group arrived at the desk we still had just over 30 minutes before our flight left we had already spent 30 minutes in line because of the horrible time management and inefficiency of the staff when we arrived at the desk the gentleman told us we missed our flight again we still had 30 minutes to get to the flight and should have already been checked in when we checked in at the zanzibar airport they then told us even if we were first in line at the desk when the plane landed an hour before takeoff we still would not have been able to board the plane why not why would they sell us a ticket on kenya airways own website that was a fraud the entire time we are talking with the desk people they are again randomly talking to other customers who just walked up like the outraged lady who was supposed to being going to one location but the kenya airways attendants booked her to the wrong country  i didnt really blame her checking their phones and essentially being some of the most atrocious customer service representatives imaginable they were flippant and did not care to make the long story shorter we were stuck in the airport until after midnight before we were moved to a hotel then returned the next morning for an afternoon flight  which was of course delayed a couple times the flight attendants were wonderful though none of the entertainment systems worked on the flight i would not recommend this airline unless you literally had no other options
259,airobi to kisumu and nairobi to mombasa with kenya airways the airline does have it share of constant emails with changes to the flight schedule very frequent the check in process i am a sky priority elite member is smooth and the staff were very good on the nairobikisumu and nairobimombasa round trips the staff on the flights are excellent the flight attendants are very well dressed and presented this is my 20th round trip domestically with the company they even manage to serve a snack samosa and a drink for a 45 minute flight however the arrival at the domestic terimal in nairobi is dated by 20 years the baggage delivery area is very outdated the arrival area outside is old and not very accomodating
260,review   nairobi to london we were held to ransom by kenyan airways staff at the boarding gate about to get on a flight to london from jomo kenyatta international airport we had a fully paid and confirmed ticket for the flight we were prevented from boarding boarding staff demanded we pay a disputed amount for a flight we had taken with a partner airline a week earlier or else they would not let us board nor would they put us on another flight they would in effect strand us in nairobi we had to pay an extra 720 which we are now trying to claim back it was extortion no matter what way you look at it go to kenya but avoid kenyan airways at all costs
261,review   nairobi to bangkok its the worst nightmare ive had our flight delayed for 12 hours but they did not let us know until last minute they promised connection hotel with shuttle but the shuttle was broken they refused to pay for taxi and water or food for the people left in the airport lobby they told us to wait outside in the night for 5 hours and yelled at us for no patience next day they did not arrange the departure flight not to mention the connection flight
262,review   excellent inflight services clean and spacious 787 we left on time and arrived punctually the airline provided a hot meal which included chicken veggies dessert coffee tea and other drinks check in was smooth at a very modern terminal in nairobi i was also impressed by the very comfortable seats i flew kenya airways from dubai to to addis ababa and also to uganda during this past august great services and on time departures all times
263,review  nairobi to mumbai with kenya airways it was a very pleasant day and suddenly we heard the news that the flight is delayed 2 hours while booking the tickets it had already been stated that the flight is often delayed by 30 minutes but had not expected the number to rise so horribly after 2 hours 30 minutes the flight arrived the cabin crew do not have a welcoming nature they served the food 3 hours 30 minutes after takeoff where other airlines start serving much sooner this journey made me more tired and i will never choose kenya airways in the future
264,review   flew kenya airways from bangkok to johannesburg via nairobi cabin attendants and meals onboard kenya airways flights are the worst i have seen most crews were lazy inefficient and unprofessional on almost all flights i took the ptv was broken while aircrafts were very new the seats already looked old due to poor maintenance nairobi airport was messy disorganised and dark
265,amsterdam to nairobi  i love flying kenya airways when i am going home and their business class is superb very spacious and comfortable good food and drink good entertainment to make the trip bearable and very friendly crew onboard the pilot even came to say hello and asked an older lady on the next seat whether she was enjoying her flight kq give me that nostalgic feeling
266,review   on the nairobimumbai route kenya airways uses a b737800 their logo mentions the pride of africa but there is not much to be proud about that flight miserable breakfast poached eggs are just warm hardboiled eggs no yoghourt offered tasteless fruit bad coffee seats are antiquated and hardly recline on the vdo games were blocked fortunately the crew is very attentive and very pleasant choice of reading materials is very limited upon arrival in mumbai my luggage was missing it was probably mishandled in nairobi though we had 2 hours transit time but no compensation was offered as on other airlines not even some amenities for the night just a few nice words and the promise it wold come on the next day wait and see despite the problems i would still recommend the airline as connection times are generally good and their 787s are very nice
267,y impressed with the service offered on these flights we had missed our booked flight et direct from djibouti to addis ababa so rebooked at the last minute onto kenya airways even at this late stage the fare was good and we departed a few hours later than originally planned the aircraft was clean with comfortable seats much better than et on similar routes and drinks and a small meal were served all of excellent quality on the first sector the crew was headed up by a purser who was excellent in his customer service and clear announcements in both french and english the crew had a good sense of humour and were ready to assist in whatever way they could transit was via the new airport terminal in nairobi one word wow this terminal is exceptional and must be the easiest to navigate most comfortable i have experienced on the continent it beats jnb cpt and others handsdown processing was swift and comfortable shops were open as were a selection of restaurants there is clearly more to come from this airport as a number of shops seem to be preparing to open gate rooms are open and comfortable with access to bathrooms nearby fantastic new airport our onward flight to addis was also good we had to wait for a large party of late passengers but the crew were thoughtful enough to offer us a glass of water or orange juice while we awaited the latecomers much appreciated another light meal breakfast and drinks were served during the flight seats were comfortable and i slept well excellent job by both crews and kenya airways
268,review   nairobi to gaborone return kenya airways and their cost cutting measures are really showing inflight and in their flagship lounge at nbo onboard what used to be a 4 course dinner service is now 3 courses with a very mediocre salad starter choice of 3 mains but all over cooked and tasteless and then a mousse like dessert no fruit no cheese and no red wine ran out of champagne half way through the flight the business class seats on embraer 190 have no leg rest and very poor recline no amenity kit so no eye mask to keep out the blaring cabin lights or ear plugs to drown out the sound of the cabin crew really wish they would return to their glorious days when one would be proud to fly kq
269,i was supposed to fly kenya airways out of nairobi to entebbe at 330 pm i get to the airport at 1pm and am told that my flight is overbooked and i will fly out at 745 pm in this way i would have missed an extremely important event in kampala i asked why i wasnt informed before and no one explained the ground staff was extremely rude no sorry no explanation not half a smile no one could care less and they never bothered to send me an email or inform me i asked for some sort of compensation and was denied until after complaining for 3 hours straight when i received 50 dollars out of my 180 ticket i asked to talk to a manager and was sent to 4 different offices where no one could give me any sort of information no wifi was available but when i asked for crew to hotspot me everyone refused so i had no way of contacting people in kampala it was the worst customer service experiences i have had i finally go to board my 745pm flight only to discover it has been delayed by one hour
270,for such a short kenya airways 45 minute flight from mombasa to nairobi the crew managed to get round whole plane with drink and snack of nuts arrived early in nairobi this caused a problem with bus to take us to terminal 10 min wait crew were very good luggage being delivered by the time we reached the terminal
271,i have flown with kenya airways before and would describe them as being cheap and cheerful with slightly above average service flights to johannesburg were on time however they ran out of meal choices and we were left with a rather disgusting fish affair i had chosen kenya airways primarily because of their generous baggage allowance ie 2 x 23kg bags as we were bringing sports equipment and motorcycle gear on our holiday all went reasonably well even given the poor meals on the outbound flight however coming back was a different matter when we arrived at johannesburg airport we were faced with a huge set of scales placed in front of the check in counter that also had its own usual scales we had to have our bags weighed and the very over officious clerk refused to take my bags as one was 3kg overweight never mind the fact that my other bag was 4kg under weight i would have understood the concerns if the total of my bags were overweight but they werent and despite my appeals for a more common sense approach and despite my bags being identically packed to the outward journey where they were checked in at heathrow with no problem i had to repack my luggage on the check in floor this in my view is a totally ridiculous rule that appears to only be applied at johannesburg i have flown kenya airways from london mombasa and nairobi on several occasions without any inconvenience on the flight to nairobi they again ran out of food choices and we were served by a very rude steward who just slammed the food if you can call it that down in front of us when we arrived in nairobi they were bussing those ending their journey there to the terminal but there were no directions for those transitting we managed to find an emergency exit and took that and were lucky to find a very impatient kenya airways employee who directed us to cross a busy airport road in the dark there was no pedestrian crossing markings and she had no high vis gear on we were lucky not to get run down by a bus that came around the corner suddenly the onward flight to heathrow passed without further incident however the breakfast served was appalling a piece of unidentifiable gristle in the dish truly the worst meal i have ever been served in over 50 years of flying kenya airways standards on this showing have definitely slipped to well below par and they need to take note
272,flew from london heathrow to entebbe via nairobi arrived early for checkin but then had to wait because one of the desks was being occupied by a family who were not travelling business but seemed to be negotiating over buying another ticket i had booked both tickets and had selected adjoining seats but by the time we had checked in these have been changed even though i had paid for the tickets i was told that i could not be told whether my travelling companion was still sitting next to me  data protection etc in fact he had been put elsewhere it was only at the gate that we managed to correct the problem the aircraft was a newish boeing 787 dreamliner and although kenya airways had not opted for a more modern seat configuration it was a relatively comfortable a slightly larger pillow would have been appreciated my ife was not working photo although given that i wanted to sleep i was not particularly worried the cabin crew apologised for not having a printed menu and instead let the passengers look at what appeared to be an email with the food options the wine was uninspiring and the food lacklustre however the cabin crew were excellent some of them had a slightly mischievous sense of humour smiling and responded quickly to requests arriving at nairobi was a disaster first the aircraft had to be towed in because of construction work and we were then put on a bus and taken to the arrivals terminal there were no signs for transit passengers and when we asked we were told that we had arrived at the wrong place needless to say nobody bothered to tell us we then went on another bus and after an absurdly long wait finally got through security the business lounge in nairobi was small and we were forced to share a table we decided to leave early and eventually the next flight to entebbe was called absolutely no priority was given to business passengers although there was a separate line passengers simply joined whichever was the shortest and the staff did nothing to ensure that those who had paid a premium were given priority treatment we realise that running an airline involves juggling numerous different priorities and not every airline can aspire to the standards of emirates or qatar airways but with a little effort and a negligible cost kenya airways could have done considerably better than this
273,kenya airways from johannesburg to dar es salaam via nairobi and back b737800 and embraer 190  all flights departed on time and all arrived earlier at destinations service from fas could not be faulted  food was ok not wow but standard for airline economy meals going to dar es salaam stopped in nairobi for few days but on return was in transit in nairobi for johannesburg time allowed was 55 minutes from arriving from dar departing to jnb and this was ample for the transfer which was smooth and painless flight back to jnb was half full and i was moved to the exit seat so very comfortable all in all quite impressed with kenya airways will use them again gladly
274,airobi to bangkok with kenya airways good boeing 787 with lay flat seats nice crew food and beverages and ife was so so great lounge with plenty space and nice showers price was very competitive and i will fly with kenya airways again
275,london heathrow to johannesburg via nairobi with kenya airways  almost new planes with very comfortable seats and plenty of space the staff were fine and friendly on demand entertainment  meals were average but acceptable none of our four flights were late at a bargain price pleasantly surprised and would happily use again
276,kenya airways flight kq584 from ndola to kenya on the 23rd december 2015 was the worst flight ive been on the toilet seat was broken very unhygienic to make matters worse the flight was full on my way back on kq101 on 24th january 2016 from london heathrow no wine or lager was served i dont drink but a lot of people complained its only right for us to be told when we buy our tickets that certain things have been withdrawn ive been flying kenya airways for a long time but i wonder if i will be using it in march when i go back to the uk
277,johannesburg to london via nairobi and the flight was overbooked when we left london we were told that our luggage was 2pcs x 23 kg and can be combined as were travelling with my partner however on return we were refused checking in johannesburg because we had one piece each weighing 25kg each trying to explain the simply mathematics to staff was a challenge we had to unwrap our luggage and repack it give away some of our clothes and rewrap the suitcases with seal film as luggage often gets broken into this cost us extra money and had to pay the difference when we did not need to very rude unprofessional arrogant and self importance  i dont think ill be flying kenya airways any time soon
278,kenya airways from jeddah to johannesburg via nairobi on 27th dec flight delayed for an hour no reason and or apology given arrived nairobi 800am connecting flight to johannesburg 825am met on the tarmac by kenya airways staff no apology no reasoning just handed us new boarding passes like sheep  move move youre on the 1220 flight obviously pre meditated the 1220 flight was delayed to 1245 with relating inconvenience to passengers catching connecting flights and pick up arrangements given that this was the christmas long week end mark me down as very disappointed at the totally unprofessional staff and lack of arranging a few min delay to accommodate the connecting flight not sure were the slogan pride of africa fits in kenya airways need staff education badly
279,kenya airways flight from johannesburg to juba via nairobi inflight service was not up to a minimum standard the meal served onboard was disgusting worst meal ever considering a 4hrs 15mins flight considering the price of ticket kenya airways is not competitive on this trip
280,london to lilongwe via nairobi ive been flying with kenya airways for close to 10 years after ba stopped flying directly to malawi ive enjoyed comfortable leg room and services at most times but this trip was just terrible after an 8hr flight they had a 6 hour wait for connection for 1235pm then when it was about 130h to go it was cancelled without any sensible reason having been tired i was angry by their lack of communication they compensated with a hotel booking about 2030min away the hotel was comfortable and had excellent services we were taken back to the airport for a 10pm flight naturally expecting to be in lilongwe by just after midnight to my horror this wasnt a direct flight but was going through zimbabwe first then back to lilongwe no sense in this whatsoever to make it worse it didnt leave until 1115pm during all this there was no apology or anything ive noticed this is becoming very common with their flights to malawi apparently where they cancel or delay without thought i regret not buying insurance because i would have claimed for a such a good airline doing well for africa its really a pity if south african airways had favourable luggage allowance for their heavy price i would have switched  the new planes are too hot for comfort  i had a hoodie and a blanket expecting the typical cold inflight temperature but no it was blazing in there
281,we flew kenya airways from london heathrow to nairobi and then 5 days later on to livingstone in zambia the return journey was a connecting flight from livingstone to heathrow via nairobi every flight was on time and the staff were all friendly however the main complaint which is significant was the temperature inside the aircraft and the cramped seating it was so hot that it felt like being suffocated and despite repeatedly asking for the temperature to be lowered nothing happened i was only wearing a vest top and crop linen trousers so could not take anything else off it was so unpleasant that i will not fly on a kenya airways boeing 787 again the cabin crew said that normal temperature is 24 degrees or people start getting cold i say to them dress accordingly and give everyone else a chance they can at least put more clothes on the seating was also extremely cramped and the seat back entertainment system didnt work properly bad form for such a new aircraft
282,i was supposed to fly at kenya airways 1025 the flight was cancelled without any notice to me i had to drive back home 30kms then go back to the airport another 30kms this means 120kms of wasted fuel when i could have been informed in advance kenya airways staff at the lilongwe city centre office did not even apologise for the inconvenience this is the second time this is happening in april this year i was to travel to botswana via nairobi and the 0230 am flight was delayed up to 6am nobody told us what was happening when i told the staff i was told i should not worry because the connecting flight to joburg would wait for all passengers delayed  i was horrified on arrival in nairobi to find i had to make my own arrangements and my onward flight to gaborone could not be booked by staff in nairobi  it was a nightmare when i got to nairobi yesterday i thought the kenya airways customer care service poster was a mockery to all the experiences i have had with kq
283,flew kenya airways bkknbojro then jronbohre then hrenbo via lusaka  bkk the long haul part of the leg 9hrs was pleasant with a new boeing 787 and quite decent food and service including choice of wines the seats are a little stiff and narrow for my size left on time from bkk arrived a little early due to tailwinds made the connection easily and arrived with bag in jro the second leg was uneventful even pleasant with great service clear announcements and a good selection of movies arrived on time in hre heading back the other direction the ride was smooth and connection in nbo was tolerable now the terminal has been upgraded and there is at least a selection of restaurants and places to sit while waiting nbobkk arrived on time i made the mistake of choosing seat 25d to sit and had other passengers continually trying to walk in front of my stretched out legs to cut across to the toilets on the other side never again for me otherwise good food and arrived in bkk at midday route to east africa is shorter and faster and cheaper than other airlines
284,i dont even know where to start i lost two days of my vacation due to flight delays from douala to dubai and kenyan airways gave the worst experience so far when i was checkingin at the counter i was quite pleased with a very helpful local ground staff before i left i gave him 5000 cfa as a tip the flight was delayed 6 hours so i checked in late as well suddenly the staff was asking furiously for additional money because his superior saw him receiving a tip and he had to share the tip with others couldnt believe this really happened he was bugging me in the most creepy way possible so i just decided to give another 5000 and left  i was supposed to leave douala at 1pm but we were only informed at around 4pm that they had to check us in overnight because there were some mechanical glitches with their plane they checked us in at 2star hotel in douala for twin sharingroom the room was like crate we were finally picked up by van and we headed back to the airport we boarded one hour late and because we were delayed for one day and i had a couple of connecting flights my entire flight schedule got messed up it seemed we were hostaged  not being histrionic but that was the feeling they didnt issue a new plane ticket and asked us to claim the next ticket in nairobi so when we were supposed to catch the next flight from nairobi to dubai we were a few minutes late and we werent able to catch the flight after 30 minutes of looking for somebody who can provide us information on how do we board the next flight we were finally advised that we had to stay overnight in nairobi and checkin at the hotel  again there were three of us who were supposed to fly to dubai we insisted that they book us etihad as it was the closest flight that time they told us that they couldnt book another airline because it would be more expensive for them they advised us instead that we could book and reimburse the expenses from them yes so if you like taking chances one can consider so we finally settled to stay overnight after they told us that we would be billeted on a 5star hotel we finally arrived at the 5star hotel only there was no airconditioning yes a hotel without an ac but a fan we left nairobi the following day and flew to dubai as soon as i get to dubai i requested my travel agent to cancel my return flight and reimburse me with my return flight they offered instead that they would upgrade my cabin class to business for my return trip the return trip had minimal delays and the business class experience was ok but when i landed in douala my luggage was missing they told us that our luggage were left behind in nairobi so we will have to wait the next day to get our luggage
285,dxb to jnb via nbo checkin in dubai took longer than expected but as most are 3rd party they dont care that much to be efficient brand new dreamliner in both legs good seat arrangement with fair pitch onboard entertainment was ok and service above standards great surprise good crew connection in nbo very smooth great value recommended
286,i flew from dxb to fih via nbo terminal 1 in dubai is really getting old and the check in can get quite slow we boarded on time and took off a bit late almost all male crew served a snack on the brand new dreamliner and breakfast before landing the transit in nbo is very quick and efficient the regional product of kq is excellent personalized ife great food for 3 hour flight and great pitch europan airlines dont even come close on medium haul flights they deserve that 4th star
287,staff are poorly trained and make no effort to assist customers we were advised of a flight delay of 2 hours when checking in from zanzibar to nairobi to our 10 am flight no formal explanation was given which coincidentally became 3 hours which then effected all our connecting flights and accommodation we were not assisted in even the slightest way having then to wait for a further 15 hours between flights till we could get to our final destination we were all advised incorrectly  this turned a precious family holiday into one with a nightmare ending thank you kenya airways for spoiling our precious time away i am disgusted by your service and lack of empathy or service values
288,on time departures and early arrivals which was good early morning flights to nbo and dar the lounge in mba was well stocked with snacks and beverages was quite comfortable was served breakfast in a 40min flight which was very impressive and it was fresh and delicious short layover so couldnt use the lounge in nbo flight crew were very helpful return had the same experience
289,mbanbobomnbomyd early morning flight from mba and a small quick connection in nbo towards bom both flights were on time the aircraft was a brand new boeing 7878 dreamliner to bom extremely comfortable aircraft inflight entertainment was updated and good choice of movies ambience of the aircraft was pleasant and seats were very comfortable the crew both on ground and inflight were cheerful helpful and smiling food was delicious return was the same experience just the very long wait in nbo connecting to myd otherwise had an excellent experience and would fly kenya airways again
290,kq782 llwnbo via lus embraer e80 seat 1f excellent service good catering and clean comfortable aircraft kept well updated by flight crew following a 15hour delay out of llw after late arrival of the aircraft kq did a good job of getting the flight turned around and back off the ground my first experience with kq and was impressed overall
291,aveled from bombay to johannesburg bomnbojnb and jnbnbobom on time departures good food no inflight entertainment in boeing 737 but available on the boeing 787 dreamliner on nbobom sector overall satisfied
292,from bangkok kq0861 to llw kq0726 via nbo on 17 april a skyteam platinum for life member the flight from bkk to nbo was ok left on time and arrived on time the service was fine in a new b787 one hour prior to the departure to llw the flight was cancelled and we were put in a hotel in town until the next day no explanations of the cancellation just operational reasons we ask for a manager to handle the situation but a supervisor told us that no one was available or reachable we ask to reschedule our flights with other airline but they could done since they need to be authorized by a manager we were rescheduled on the next flight 12 hours latter via lusaka reaching llw at 230 am the following day after three days since i left bkk of course no compensation at all after wasting 2 working days in the airport of nairobi they have invested heavily in planes but the service to clients is really poor the quality of service is really gone down and they are forgetting that other alternatives are possible nowadays
293,i had paid a lot of money to fly my young sons as unaccompanied minors their ticket said it would take 1 hour to fly from mt kilimanjaro to nairobi noone said anything on check in however they ended up going via zanzibar and arrived into nairobi 3 hours late the missed their connecting flights and were stranded in the airport no one met them at the plane and no one helped them they were told to sleep at the airport overnight after they bought a phone card and rang me i then got onto the airline and they eventually helped them to stay overnight at a hotel in town and put onto flights the next day if i had not pushed them they would be sleeping at the airport for 20 hours two young children totally irresponsible i will never use the airline again
294,mydnboebb flights were on time on both lags the business class lounge at the new terminal 1a was excellent nice hot meals of different varieties comfortable seats and sleeping area wc were clean and sparkling inflight and ground crew were both very helpful and smiling the flight time were short but enjoyed the service
295,kq861  860 hkgbkkhkg first flight with kenya airways turned out to be the worst air travel experience the outbound flight was cancelled without prior notice passengers kept queuing in front of kenya airways counter at hkg airport with no information staff at the counter asked passengers to wait in the queue for hours until finally the airline managed to offer an alternative flight with another airline but will depart 5 hours later very poor management of the situation passengers were confused and exhausted
296,my wife and i used the airline for 8 flights to and in east africa from heathrow recently the aircrafts were new clean and comfortable staff were excellent on every flight and could not have done more for us hitherto we have used british airways because they happen to fly direct to entebbe but now we will always use their nairobi connection even though there is a stop off kenya airways attitude and their lovely staff make the ba crates and ageing crews on the african routes no longer acceptable
297,i am a seasoned business traveller for 40 years flew kenya airways bangkok to dar es salaam via nairobi in feb 2015 initially was nervous because the business ticket price was so low less than half the nearest competitor however on the downside flight left 30 mins late no big deal on the upside access to air france lounge new dreamliner with flat beds good pillows and big warm blankets great entertainment service was very good and the food was fine transit through nairobi using simba lounge  good facilities cooked breakfast etc then onto dar in an older 737 but still comfortable and well cared for i have travelled with the best and this was as good as any business class trip i have had with any major airline
298,flew business class round trip cdg paris tofrom nbo nairobi on the wonderful new kenya airways 787 dreamliner cdgnbo 113 on jan115 and nbocdg 112 on jan 915 what an airliner and what wonderful service by the caring flight staff the plane really is the best airliner in the sky right now quiet w photochromatic adjustable oversized windows excellent air circulation and higher humidity as for kenya airways they made these two flights extremely comfortable with great food excellent south african wines great lay flat seats 222 configuration very adequate inflight av and very caring services presentation in addition the pride and simba lounges at the new jomo kenyatta international airport terminal are world class now as well with excellent food beverage tvs quiet areas beautiful bathrooms w showers quality wifi connection  everything you would expect from a skyteam partner
299,on this very short flight from nairobi to kilimanjaro i flew on a brand spanking new e190 was very impressed with the plane  plenty legroom love the big windows and each seat also had its own builtin ife screen never seen that on a regional jet staff are very friendly and if you sit on the left hand side of the plane you can see kilimanjaro towering at 5895 m as youre landing in arusha
300,i was flying from nbibom and bomnbi in 777300 and return was 777200 check in went well during both flights inflight service was good the flight attendants were polite and helpful the seats are pretty comfortable i would recommend this airline
301,kq 202 on 312015 kq203 on 912015 nbobomnbo first of all i will compliment the new kq terminal which is excellent the flight was on a new boeing 777300er departed on time the flight was full meal was good and i asked for a second round despite the flight being full the air hostess without any hesitation and with a smile on her face served me for the 2nd time the seats were comfy and ife was ok needs an update and increase the movie and music options return flight was also good ground service crew were all kind and helpful departed on time and landed on time to would recommend kq to everyone who would like to travel to kq route network keep up the good work kq
302,flew from paris via amsterdam to nairobi the 777300 from amsnbo was a new aircraft the seat width and pitch was ok the seat back entertainment was fairly limited the food and beverage service was extremely slow bearing in mind that the flight departed at 2040 the service did not begin for at least 2 hours after take off cabin crew was pleasant and helpful my return flight was on the dreamliner the seat pitch and width were ok however the seat itself is very hard i had to use the small pillow they provide to sit on i cant say that i noticed a huge difference between the dreamliner and the 777 other that the size of the aircraft if i was doing that route again i would consider flying with kq
303,it was with some trepidation that i used kenya airways for a last minute flight up to the uk from zambia however i have to say that i was really surprised by how much they have improved in the 6 years since i last used them the embraer jet from lusaka to nairobi was clean the meal small but tasty and there was some ife on the seat back tvs the plane seemed quite new and the staff efficient and smiling punctuality was also excellent an even bigger surprise was the new modern airport at nairobi we were transferred quickly onto the london flight and although it was an older 777 it was not full so there were many spare seats at the back again we were on time getting to london well done kq on all that you have achieved
304,yesterday we were on a direct flight from lagos to nairobi except that without previous notice the plane landed in cotonou benin for over one hour not only that but the airplane didnt have air conditioning during the first two ours of flight i had purchased and paid for a direct flight in business class and i was given a flight with one layover in a class for animal or merchandise transport i cant believe that they call themselves the pride of africa
305,mbanbobomnbomba all flights were on time and arrived earlier than the ata flight attendants and ground service were very friendly onboard meal was ok and flight was comfortable too would for sure fly kq again and hopefully fly kq all the time i choose to travel
306,flew nboams b777300 business class and nbojnbnbo dreamliner  b737800 business class during last month the jnb sectors with a 1year old baby and all flights a true pleasure brand new aircraft on all sectors particularly impressed with the b787 and b737800 excellent service by the cabin crew particularly on the sectors traveling with baby  very helpful new pride lounge at nbo is worldclass in terms of design and finishes food onboard and in the nbo lounge remains somewhat mediocre the rest is tiptop
307,i flew from nairobi to amsterdam towards the end of november the new 777s have a good business class cabin and the seats offer a nice level of comfort the quality of food and drink was good and is getting closer to that offered by the bigger international airlines on this route i have always found kenya airways cabin crews pleasant and helpful but i did not see much of them between meal services it would be nice if they made a tour of the cabin at reasonable intervals just to see if anyone needs anything rather than waiting to be called
308,recently flew from lhr to nairobi on to kilimanjaro and then return with kenya airways both of the long haul flights were overnight and the major bonus of flying with this carrier is that the plane was 23 empty on the outbound leg so we got 3 seats each and a great nights sleep and halffull on the return so we had 3 seats between 2 of us however on the outbound journey none of the seatback tvs worked in the centre and right hand seats most were just dead others flickered fitfully and most annoying my screen just wouldnt turn off also the reading lights didnt work so it was a good job we could sleep however all four flights departed and arrived on time and the cabin crew didnt wake us up for breakfast
309,i recently flew man to mba via ams and nbo overall a very pleasant flight all flights took off and landed on time ill only mention the ams to nbo to mba sections because they were all kenya flights the 777300 er from ams to nbo had the 333 arrangement which meant a little more room than i usually get on other airlines the food was decent enough the wine ok and plenty off it the service although not perfect was fine the ife is not upto emirates quality but since i dont sit for the entire flight the movie choice was ok the flight from nbo to mba was on a well equipped embraer 190 which even had its own ife quite a novelty on a short hop flight and something ive never seen in europe the only fly in the ointment was nbo but that is not the airlines fault thats kaas issue its a bit of a nightmare for an international arrival with a domestic transfer but overall a decent flight i would certainly fly them again
310,recently took four kenya airways flights between london and tanzania and every flight arrived at the destination early staff were friendly and helpful food was good and the flight price was excellent for this time of the year i fly this route 2 or 3 times a year always with kenya airways and im yet to be disappointed
311,flew from nbo to joburg with friends on golfing holiday group of 12 we fly kq a lot in kenya and we all knew its a horrible airline before we booked but we did not have much choice and were ok because kq normally fly golf bags for free nope  theyve changed their minds on this route and tried to sting us each for 120 excess baggage one couple paid and the rest of us refused  they finally let us on because we were holding up the checkin for everyone else no inflight entertainment of course but flight was actually on time which is a nice change for kq my wife and i booked our seats in advance but found they had been given up to others part of my group so we did not make a fuss and my wife and were given seats two rows apart luckily other people were prepared to swap so we could sit together hopelessly unprofessional airline from time of booking to time of landing but what can you do id never fly kq if i had a choice flight back was exactly the same except they let us bring our clubs for free because we had a letter from the tour operator saying we were entitled
312,bodel we were served only 1 samosa each for dinner mumnbo flight was cancelled but before i left nbo the office confirmed that i was reserved on the next flight on enquiring a day before travel was informed that i wasnt booked he booked me then lucky enough there was space nbomum they said theres an hours delay it was actually 8 hours delayed missed the connecting flight to kolkata paid an extra 3500 rupees for the next flight only the return from delnbo was on time and well managed kq never again
313,i flew business class from bangkok to nairobi and it was one of my worst flight experiences the business class cabin was virtually empty 3 other passengers the food was the same as economy a chickenpattyhamburger with overcooked vegetables and none of the wines on the impressive wine list were available  only the nz chardonnay they were serving in economy the ife did not work which i reported to the purser  was on the same plane same seat on return journey  still not working on arrival at nairobi i was woken on final approach  no time for even a cup of coffee the stewardess said she had not wanted to wake me  but had not asked the night before if i would be wanting breakfast a much shorter flight and also more expensive than qatar which i usually choose on this route never again
314,our flight from guangzhou to bangkok was cancelled this is actually not something unusual however the handling of this situation by the local staff was an absolute disaster initially the flight was delayed for three hours until they eventually made the decision to cancel it we were put up in a below average hotel and left in the dark about further arrangements the next day we called them every half hour but they themselves did not know what went on furthermore they told us that we could not easily get our luggage in the end i had to get very angry only then did they become more cooperative however the pilot did not allow the luggage to be released from the airport until the afternoon of the next day due to this we almost missed the next flight never again
315,flew return london to nairobi with the pride of africa the website is amateur looking and booking a seat is confusing i did book with a travel agent and they said we would have to pay for extra legroom seats however when i logged on i discovered row 33 dfg were all free to book with extra leg room the service was basic food was bad my entertainment system was old and did not work  when i asked a member of staff to look they just walked off so 8 hours with no entertainment system the fact i had legroom helped me to relax a man sitting next to me said their entertainment systems quite often do not work staff looked like they did not want to be there on returning from zanzibar we were told we would have to pay 100 each for extra leg room as the card machine was not working on the kenya airways desk my friend was taken for a 45 minute walk to get this booked terrible experience and i would never fly with them again
316,we have been using kq for the past 14 years out of malawi and it is a lovehate relationship i trust the pilots and the airline technicians if kq management would go the extra step they would graduate into another category however very often its the individual flight attendants that keep me booking and flying kq we flew economy and business  both with different experiences i was about not to book kq anymore until the new dreamliner came in nice aircraft  friendly crew the inflight service needs improvement i have had better service in economy than in business class at times the inflight entertainment program and equipment did not work on previous flights both classes except the new planes would i fly kq again yes but if i can fly klm equipment i would chose klm because it is predictable in terms of standard and quality the new dreamliners will only be attractive as long as kq maintains these aircraft well and keeps them clean and the inflight entertainment works
317,bodxb they have started flying the b772 on this route pleasant and comfortable flight very welcome break from the ageing b767 ac attentive crew and cabin service seems to have been revamped plenty of drinks rounds etc the only qualm is the catering to basic and could do with some improvement overall a good flight
318,i travelled to uganda via nairobi kenya last month the plane rides differ massively in quality the flight to kenya left on time but i feel it was let down by many things 1 the plane being very old 2 a lot of the tvs dont work mine did but the film like many other people said stopped working near the end 3 the food quality was really bad i however then had a flight from nairobi to uganda and this was really good the plane was very new and had working tvs with pretty new films it was only 1 hour flight another thing was we got served food and drinks this was far better than the flight from london
319,i flew from nairobi to paris on the new boeing 787 that now operates this route the aircraft is new and has great inflight entertainment seats are comfortable and legroom is good im a tall guy and i really struggle with legroom on most aircrafts the crew were very friendly overall great experience
320,amsterdam  narobi on new b777300er an excellent flight  comfortable seats with very good legroom the base of the seat goes forward when the back reclines which makes it far more comfortable for sleeping kenya airways have kept a 333 arrangement so the seats are wider food tasty and cabin crew friendly and professional nice welcome from captain good inflight entertainment connecting flight to daressalaam equally straightforward and comfortable very keen to use kenya airways again  far superior to klm who they codeshare the amsnbo route with
321,i have flown london  lilongwe  london the past few weeks i arrived safely it is disappointing that the in flight entertainment system does not work london  nairobi  london it amused me that the crew still hand out the headphones apparently headphones keep passengers amused  until they realise nothing works the food was good goat stew  avoid the breakfast eggs the cabin crew excellent the airline survives on its route network  and cheap flights with codeshare flights check what airline is actually providing the flight i am using kenya airways again this month would i use them if there was a realistic alternative on the routes not sure but i still rated kenya airways 4 out of 5 for value for money
322,kq116 2014626 from nairobi to amsterdam we had a very good flight with friendly stewards a very good nbobkk checked in online got a boarding pass from a selfservice machine at nairobis low tech but charming and functional terminal passengers were processed through to a holding area with ample seating in time to board on time via a short walk across the tarmac to our waiting newbuild 767300 which had a pleasant signature by boeing 777style interior pushed close to schedule and were soon on our way announcements describing the service to come were clear and accurate ife was on a rolling loop and some channels werent working so i read instead meal was very basic  curried fish with rice a bread roll a small dessert but adequate trays were cleared away promptly and cabin lights extinguished allowing plenty of time on the 9h25m sector for sleep two hours before landing another hot meal of similar proportions was served one other bonus the crew were not too obsessed with making pax close their blinds permitting some sunlight in for the last few hours which made waking up a gradual process as blinds were raised one by one landed on time and left with a kindhearted farewell at the end of a great first experience with kenya airways
323,kq116 2014626 from nairobi to amsterdam we had a very good flight with friendly stewards a very good entertainment and good food and drinks we will ever fly again with this company
324,15th june kq 202 i travelled to mumbai the boeing 777200er was good comfortable seats service was great and friendly i am sure this airlines will become one of the best with the new dreamliners and 777300er
325,kenya airways used to be one of my favourite carriers  ok they were not in the same league as emirates but they did a good job considering the price over the last few years things have been going steadily downhill and over the last few trip i have done with them they have reached new depths the inflight entertainment system simply does not work on the londonnairobi flight and the aircrew are clearly aware that the system has simply died they promised a new system and new planes are coming soon  i just hope it is soon enough to save the airline
326,i flew lhrnbo return and was generally satisfied by the service its nothing special but the 777 are relatively comfortable showing some sign of age  the best feature in both directions was that there were plenty of spare seats so passengers were able to spread out and i found the overnight timings most convenient i found the food and drink poor however particularly hard to face food overstrained tea and vile juice and the inflight entertainment distinctly average limited range of films poor sound quality broken in several seats basically its an acceptable inflight experience that gets you efficiently from a to b and the ground experience is much more professionalcompetent than many other african airlines from my experience staff were generally friendly with exception of some checkin staff at nbo who were grumpy
327,avelled on kq from nairobi to bangkok in economy a horrible experience pride of africa what a joke the food was terrible the seating in the 767 was so tight that i have has better space in much smaller aircrafts the on board service was despicable the staff acted as though they were doing you a favour by serving food and drink i would never travel kenya airways again
328,he inflight entertainment only worked for some people mine didnt work at all the flight was full so we had no option of moving the flight was more than 6 hours so it was very boring the were only 2 options for food chicken or vegetarian naturally most people chose chicken so by the time the staff got to us there was only vegetarian food left we didnt get much to drink either ive either been spoiled by emirates excellent service or this airline is just very poor because i was absolutely disgusted by the service
329,mbanbocannbomba 1st leg was an embraer e190 and the 2nd was a new boeing 777300er the flight was good had 3 seats all the way to can to myself and slept very comfortably business class service in economy flight attendants were responsive to calls and gave good service return had a problem of checked in luggage which was removed due to power banks inside was informed about it by a kq staff but then due to language barrier and a lazy security guard who didnt want to walk all the way to the check in counter told me all was ok and to board reaching nbo i didnt get my bag for 2 days all in all the flight was good and on time both ways
330,i have flown a number of times on the bangkoknairobi route and had a mixed set of experiences seats are good for sleeping and food is edible mostly i approach it as super premium economy with some business perks and i am not disappointed i rarely watch inflight entertainment but it doesnt work sometimes  that is a fact dont expect too much in terms of communication if there is trouble but they have generally been okay with us only one serious delay in 8 years door wouldnt close and we were treated okay in business slow but sure but the economy passengers were left at the gate all night with minimal information late refreshments and little help basically they were dumped because kenya airways only had enough staff left on duty to take care of us and they had to wait until we were shuttled off to our hotel before they got any attention
331,just last week i was on another kenya airways flight but this time the experience far from what id expected the aircraft itself had only just returned to nairobi with a full load of passengers about an hour before we boarded it of course it had been prepared for our flight but not well enough  the toilet i used even before departure was grubby the carpeting on the floor of the passenger cabin still had tiny remnants of a food spill from the previous flight the inflight entertainment system worked only partly  the flight tracker did not work at all throughout the 8 hr flight to amsterdam  the choice in movies and music was so limited and the sound quality so inadequate a far cry from the very enjoyable flight on the klm b747400 that had flown me on the outward leg but the food was fairly good and there was one or two particularly attractive flight attendants
332,8 flights in 6 weeks with the pride of africa 4 flights without the inflight entertainment working whole rows of seats had similar problems all 777 staff not able nor did they appear to care about the problems letter to kq had a few platitudes back dont fly kq long haul
333,my wife and i arrived in guangzhou on 26 dec 2013 from melbourne to connect with kenya airways to nairobi in summery we faced lots of inconveniences simply due to language problems the flight to nairobi was cancelled but none of the staff could tell us what was going on the airline should consider having swahili or english speaking staff permanently stationed in guangzhou
334,flew nboams on b777 flight was on time and aircraft quite new the staff were nice there could have been more thorough pretakeoff and prelanding aisle checks for seat belts etc the entertainment system was ok good choice of movies but the sound was low the food was ok we departed on time the business class seats were comfortable and the cabin was clean a rather good experience
335,first time traveller with ka and returning with them also but given the choice to the same destination next time i will make sure the flight is with klm the reason for my disappointment was the food provided the breakfast served was pathetic fruit juice yoghurt bread roll margarine and jam and a bagel are not for me then on the connecting flight to mombasa i received an apple turnover and some coffee sorry ka but that just isnt breakfast to me cabin crew were friendly and efficient flight was good but to lose customers for poor food is pretty bad
336,flew amsnbo on b777 and nbocdg on the b767300 the b777 was fine but nothing special friendly staff slightly little legroom but fine ife ok not much choice and slightly bad sound but still fine the temporary arrivals terminal in nbo is small but efficient the b767 was worse legroom was extraordinary small the only thing that made it bearable to sit for almost 9 hours at the seat was that i had two seats for myself quite old plane too entertainment system was not on demand good staff however and the food was ok the b777 is recommended try to avoid the old b767
337,16th feb 2014 lhrnairobi flight on time very clean aircraft not full so able to spread out comfy chairs good ife and movie choice food was delicious requested vegan meal and it was delivered cabin crew were lovely and attentive drinks were given by the double honestly couldnt fault them brilliant flight
338,flew from nbo to heathrow on the 777 flight delayed 45 mins because otherwise we would have arrived at heathrow before 6am on a sunday surely the operations people could have scheduled the flight accordingly seats were rock hard and uncomfortable service by the all male cabin crew was erratic ife was ok not recommended but there is a distinct lack of competition on this route so there is not a lot of choice
339,kq860 nbobkk 767300 flight was 99 full and ground staff and fas were efficient with the boarding process and managed to get everyone seated in time despite the large amount of duty free items brought on board there were a lot of chinesethai flight attendants to deal with the chinesethai speaking passengers hand luggage size rules were generally obeyed by passengers flight arrived about an hour early fas were friendly and had good english good selection of beverages and generous amounts food was also good leg room and seat width was adequate good magazine a few noticeable issues the turning off of electronic devices prior to takeoff and landing was not enforced by staff and staff were also not strict enough with regards to passengers standing up going to the toilets etc during taxiing there could have been more thorough pretakeoff and prelanding aisle checks for seat belts etc by the fas sometimes there were no announcements by fas when the seatbelt sign was turned on by the captain during turbulence and passengers of whom disobeyed the sign were not told to hurry up and sit down  people continued to move around the cabin there were seat back tvs channels but the content was not working blank black screens on all channels except for the flight data fas were notified but could not be fixed the safety video needs updating and the audio from the loudspeakers was too soft there were no night aisle walks by fas with waterjuice  they seemed to disappear after the meal service overall good for an african airline and has improved over the past years but needs a few more finishing touches before it is on par with a lot of other major international carriers good value for money
340,i travelled on 24th december from nbodar we travelled on quite a new embraer 190 very clean though boarding was late we still left on time and arrived on time ife was working though it was very boring the crew were constantly hardworking and kind of strict the return flight darnbo was quite the same a rather older embraer 190 boarding late again but we took off and arrived on time at least the cabin crew were much kinder upon arrival we found our baggage at the new arrivals terminal which i have to say is the most beautiful african terminal ive seen with all that i have to say i had the best regional flights ever thumbs up to kenya airways short haul flights
341,mydnbo it was an embraer e170 took off on time and landed 20 min early was travelling with my infant and so they gave me a very good service at both airports  malindi airport and jomo kenyatta international airport gave me a front seat so i sat very comfortably throughout the flight inflight was also impressive was served snacks with very cheery fas got a very nice view of the mount kilimanjaro peak which was informed to us by the captain overall i would prefer kq as my first choice
342,flew from hrelhr via nbo in economy the hrenbohre sector was on the e190 cabin was clean cabin crew were friendly and attentive nbolhr was on the b7772 seats were not that comfortable could not sleep lhrnbo flight got delayed by over an hour disappointed arriving at hre to find out one bag was lost only to arrive 2 days later
343,flew from nboams then connection on klm to the us i fly using this itinerary every six months and have done for the last four years rather mediocre service this flight was delayed for two hours due to the fact that the passenger loader was not working no announcements were made in the lounge the simba lounge was closed to me even though i showed the delta club membership check in at the counter was subpar as was lining up for immigration asked for water for medication i was taking three times if you are sleeping they do not serve you nor leave the headset etc in the magazine pouch in front of you on arrival in amsterdam you are met with armed security personnel checking your passport
344,flight from nbo to msa good experience and seem like high standards used the simba lounge as well there was a huge storm in nbo and the staff checked and rechecked the boarding passes an elderly lady was in a wheelchair and couldnt don the plastic raincoats they gave us for the trip to the plane no passenger loader no one helped her with the raincoat i helped her and then asked the kq staff to help out they just stood around i guess expecting to be told what to do another check by the loading stairs then another check at the entrance of the aircraft with lines forming and people getting wet otherwise the flight was ok
345,bomba it was a new embraer e190 flight was on time flight was full fa were in a sparkling mood ever smiling and welcoming was served with nuts and soft drinks good information from the first officer ife was working but flight time was short overall had a nice flight
346,we flew overnight lhr to nairobi then back overnight 8 days later after our kuoni safari both were 777200 quite old but seemed well maintained seats 333 firm but leg room ok seat allocation very good on outward trip it was under 80 full and they gave us 3 seats for the 2 of us staff very cheery and efficient drinks plentiful food good except breakfast on return boring no fruit toilets kept clean  dry took tablets so cant comment on ifa no problems at nairobi airport despite the fire
347,bangkok to nairobi old plane with passengers already on board transiting from china food and rubbish everywhere ripped seats that do not recline no music or tvmovies at all not even a large screen nearby very long flight with young children with no entertainment would not fly with them again we had ordered a child meal but were told they had run out
348,bojub juba south sudannbo excellent flights in a new embraer 190 both ways aircraft clean and appealing onward flight on time full service 3 option hot meals offered drinks plenty inc alcoholic beverages fa service excellent despite flight completely full in both classes granted lounge access in nbo and 60 kg luggage due to skyteam gold status flight back to nbo also about full departed 30 minutes prior to scheduled arrived similarly early food was less good only 2 options goat and chisken and of much smaller size and meat was grinded 2 wines are offered absolutely undrinkable inflight entertainment not working despite individual monitors mounted power outlets at every seat tickets expensive as kq enjoys very little competition on the route
349,ble experience with kenya airways flew from london to nairobi in september after losing our luggage they didnt seem very concerned or willing to help we had to keep complaining to get them to do anything and kept getting passed from one employee to another the next morning we had to fly from nairobi to kilimanjaro on precision air which is a subsidiary of kenya airways and got bumped from our flight until 12 hours later then they didnt take anyones luggage on the flight they told us that the luggage would arrive the next day but it didnt arrive until 4 days later by that time we were on mount kilimanjaro using rented and purchased gear at no time did the airline offer to reimburse us finally at the end of our trip we had to fly on kenya airways from nairobi to london we arrived at the airport 3 hours before the flight and when we checked in the agent told us we were on standby we created a big enough stink that they gave us our boarding passes then the flight was 3 hours late departing also on both air kenya flights the food wasnt very good and the inflight entertainment units didnt work well if we ever fly back to africa we would never fly kenya airways again
350,mbanbocannbomba it was a quite old boeing 767300er but well maintained flight was on time very hard working in a sparkling mood and attentive airline crew members good information from captain and purser i was impressed keep it up kenya airways
351,bokisnbo domestic 1114 september respectively both flights on time aircrafts airbus 320 and embraer 190 respectively were clean and wellfunctioning the temporary airport in nbo now have established a cozy tented temporary lounge for elite flyers good initiative as compared to 2 weeks ago drink and snack 2 bags of nuts service on board but no hot drinks offered 50 minutes flights no entertainment no gate corridors must walk on the tarmac to and from plane fa staff nice and caring despite busy viplounge in kisumu accessed by flying blue gold card but must pay for all the items served
352,boedlnbo domestic flights all on time due to the newly burnt nbo airport boarding was primitive and lengthy and we were 510 passengers who lost our flight due to lack of calls for boarding other routes were announced clearly as there was a mess in the temporarily domestic airport there were no facilities no signboard nor search for passengers strangely enough my luggage was unloaded correctly but i was furious as i was accused for no show despite sitting straight in front of the only exit way in the tent where all domestic passengers had to walk through to their flights however some apology was received and they rebooked me instantly for the following morning but only as a prioritized waitlist passenger however i got the last seat and was pleased to eventually get it otherwise all flights on time pleasant faservice and good announcements on board almost new aircrafts embraer 175 and 170 respectively no lounges available despite holding skyteam gold after request they offered me 1 snack and 1 soft drink in nairobi the lounge in edl not available for nonvips
353,lhrnbolhr lhrnbo departed on time aircraft was a very tired 777200 er nvod didnt work food was very poor the only upside was the flight attendants who were always helpful seats were extremely uncomfortable and i could feel springs most airline food is never very good but this was awful it was very over cooked and was all stuck together nbolhr departed over an hour late as aircraft was parked at the wrong part of the airport so we were made to sit in a tent on the apron in darkness until someone got fuel for a generator once on the aircraft it was again a rather tired 777200 er and was again in a seat which probably hasnt seen a cushion in 10 years nvod still didnt work which made for a long flight food was marginally better again i cannot fault cabin crew who were very attentive overall though it was not enough to make me want to book with kq again
354,usaamsnrb flight fine until we got to nrb late evening and had to deal with kenyan customs who extort money i had no extra or overweight luggage but was told i had to pay duty for my toddler nieces and nephews clothes while i watched multitude of passengers go by with extra tots nrbamsusa flight had the worst meals breakfast croissant and bread fas appeared tired and bothered when requested for anything especially water the food products were dirty yoghurt with old dried yoghurt on the side tray appeared messyhaphazardly setup food was better when it was under nas service has really declined what a shame
355,overnight flight to nairobi from schipol seating was very uncomfortable where sleep was near impossible service onboard was attentive on the return flight to schipol i found the food tray to be dirty service was reasonable but not as good as the outbound flight i have flown with kenya airways for some 9 years for some reason the overall service has slipped ive just compared kenya airways with ba where the cost is some 400 higher the journey time is much reduced and i would be reasonably confident that ba can match or beat kenya airways on service
356,dxbnbo operated by kenya airways codeshare with su boeing 767200 in a 232 seat configuration aircraft a bit old but well maintained flight full overbooked on business class 1 person was downgraded i got one of the very last seats in the middle of an 232 configuration but the staff were good hardworking in a sparkling mood and attentive ordered 2 drinks and was given 2 of each as to make up for busy fas and few rounds of service this happened to everybody who cared but only at the first service ife on large plenum screen worked surprisingly well good information from captain and purser aircraft parked far from gate luggage delivery at the belts in nairobi messy with tonnes of unpicked suitcases all over the place monitors were not properly working thus need to check 6 belts to get luggage as staff were giving incoherent information
357,airobi  lusaka in july 2013 was worried as have experienced kqs long haul service before and nairobi airport is horrendous however this was a great flight new embraer 190 individual ife that worked good inflight service departurearrival on time given they have no real competition on this route i was impressed
358,cdgnboebb and ebbnboams first flight was an hour late in departing ife had a horrible crackle only 5 movies on the 767300 one of which they only showed half of food was ok school dinner like really only got a lunch meal pasta followed by chicken curry and apple pie dinner was a tuna roll which is not a dinner considering the flight was landing at 9pm and 9 hrs long seats were uncomfortable material very lose and faded nboebb was a brand new embraer 190 excellent comfort leather seats steak and cheese roll much better same on the return leg but got a continental breakfast nboams was a 777200er similarly poor condition but had new ife 20 movies but some didnt work my ife worked on the my side of the plane seat fghj the other side ae were all broken meals again were poor wont be flying again klm ba or emirates next time
359,outbound yyzjnb via ams and nbo inbound jnbyyz via nbo and ams flew klm on yyzams on an old soon to be retired mighty md11 but the cabin looked new flight on time no ptvs in business class but i slept almost the entire flight service was great had an 8 hour layover in amsterdam nightmare began when boarding the amsnbo flight plane was a moderate boeing 777200er garbage all over the floor no ptvs seats that cant recline for standard business class and some broken tray tables left an hour late the food for business class looked like plastic and it somewhat tasted like plastic arrived 15 minutes late the next morning nairobis airport was in very poor shape nbojnb  luckily it was the gate next to where i arrived flight was operated by an old boeing 737700 seats better than amsnbo flight cabin clean but some tray tables were missing flight delayed because of morning traffic congestion flight attendants very polite arrived later than scheduled on the return the jnbnbo flight wasnt delayed but the boeing 737700 was awful the next day we board at around 8am but the plane wasnt even at the gate a replacement airplane a very poor looking boeing 767300er was towed to the gate at 900 boarded at 945 and left at 1015 served the worst breakfast and lunch arrived an hour late in amsterdam had a 5 hour layover waiting to travel with klm aircraft was a new airbus a330200 on time flight even arrived earlier in toronto business class cabin was great no ptvs though this will be the first and last time i will fly kenya airways
360,jnbnbo in a 737 plane arrived late took off late seating on the 737 a bit cramped for a flight of this distance served a late lunch fair quality no ife no magazine in my seat pocket did not enjoy this trip nairobi airport 5 hour layover very poor airport to spend time in dark and gloomy no seats to lie down in big big wait to get food at the poor restaurantsnack place cold chicken pie could only manage a bit of it you cannot even watch the planes arriving and leaving avoid nbo if longer than 1 hour nbolhr on 777 ok economy fair ife very hard to work out and not a good choice dinner  fair at best breakfast before arrival very poor hard to get a second cup of coffee compares well to ryanair
361,addnboadd both flights on time easy check in wonderful new aircraft the embraer 190 lifts the whole experience above almost all medium haul flights in my entire life i volunteered to downgrade on the addnbo leg as the flight was sold out and i was only standby despite having a booking however the ticket was issued for the following morning and i had the choice either to downgrade or to wait but even the economy class was a very good experience despite being full lots of food 2 food options  vegetarian constant refill of drinks and the aircraft completely clean and staff observant and kind and quick not denied anything on the way back same excellent service even the taxfree worked well very detailed enjoyable and interesting info from captain on both legs the entire cockpit staff was introduced and likewise the chief purser nice seats spacious with poweroutlets a great experience ife seemed not working but who cares
362,flew from fbm to hkg it was pretty old 767 aircraft half of the entertainment system didnt work always afraid of whether the baggage will arrive or not uncomfortable seats one of the flight attendant behaviour flying out was very impolite
363,hey have repeatedly failed to deliver service befitting their alleged title as the pride of africa sydney to nairobi via bangkok in april and december 2012 and the experience was appalling kq took over from bkk and fas were very rude dismissive and rolled their eyes at simple and polite requests for essentials such as a blanket and water when my first blanket request was ignored i pushed the fa button only for a passing fa to turn it off harshly and storm off while i was trying to explain what i needed eventually i gave up there was no entertainment although this was a 15 or so hour flight the seats were really uncomfortable and bathrooms were disgusting but i have to say the food was the only highlight never flying kq again though
364,great overnight flight from lhr to nairobi on time delightful service good food generous with drinks only issue was shortish time between dinner and breakfast connection to entebbe smooth on time new plane same quality of service baggage arrived absolutely no complaints
365,airobi to bangkok it was an overnight flight that was continuing to guangzhou an older aircraft entertainment system didnt work food was inedible the staff however were delightful cheap tickets that got us to our destination  would definitely pay more in the future to avoid such an unpleasant experience
366,lhrnbonda flew 17 dec boarding was quick and efficient flight was delayed leaving heathrow due to baggage needing to be taken off the plane because of no passengers an understandable security measure and the pilot entertained us with his flight plan food was good and staff were friendly and attentive landed on time in nairobi second leg to ndola was uncomfortable seated in emergency exit aisle with very straight seat unable to recline seat slipped forward so the metal was exposed return leg via nairobi was good seat for nairobi to london was broken so would not stay reclined ife was good both ways as was all food and drink served
367,we travelled for the first time with kenyan airways and found staff very friendly and helpful the food on board was adequate and hot the seats were not very comfortable seat pitch poor and not much room the return trip was on a newer aircraft i think and the onboard entertainment system worked fine
368,more than happy with the service from malindi to nairobi the travel agent messed up my ticket and did not have the ticket available at the airport they were kind and patient and even came on board to make sure i was fine i even was upgraded to business it was such a short flight but the additional leg room was nice and seats were comfortable flight is only 40 minutes  time for a snack hot towel and soda
369,24 dec 2012 travelled kq 484 from nbodar a midday flight we boarded quite early and waited a long time to depart embraer190 was very clean and new had a delicious meal and arrived ontime and found our luggage on our return flight boarded ontime and we left 10 minutes earlier than scheduled the passengers seated in front of me fully lowered his seat which made me quite uncomfortable during both trips however the crew were kind
370,aveled to nbo on 31 sep 2012 flight delayed due to the fact that a jacket was found in a seat with no passenger attached to it a few mumbled announcements were made to find the passenger a security delay was announced followed by a need to refuel the aircraft before takeoff many passengers missed their onward flights seats were incredibly uncomfortable felt like there was no padding and my seat cushion slipped forward revealing the metal base of the seat very uncomfortable inflight service did not work no matter how many times they rebooted it certain seats were still noops headphones were falling apart and the one pair that was not was of no use as the socket on the seat i was sitting in and the one next to me was broken the meal service was similar to what you would expect on a charter flight very basic breads cold to frozen and dry salad was tired and limp i will not be flying kq in futre unless i can pay for a c class ticket
371,5 nov 2012 kq116 nairobi to amsterdam boeing 767 morning flight i booked to fly klm for both out and inbound journeys but unfortunately found myself obliged to fly kq for the return seats and fittings equally dilapidated as the kq flight to paris that i now systematically avoid inflight entertainment was simply missing i didnt think any airline would put these kind of flights on popular international routes 2 hrs after takeoff the breakfast trolley is rolling past 1 hour later flight attendant offers me a tray with bread croissant butter and juice announcing continental breakfast half an hour later im still waiting for a hot drink in the meantime the captain is apologising about late takeoff from nairobi as if it was something to be proud of tea eventually comes 1 hour after continental breakfast incidentally the temperatures in the cabin is kept glacial this is nothing compared to lunch after a terribly long wait to only to end up with a repeat of the earlier back and forth game of trolleys and trays partially empty trays trays with this or that missing my salad comes with the inside of the already unsealed lid smeared with what looks like chocolate pudding we are a long cry from the fancy looking menu proudly presented at the onset of flight between 2003 and 2007 kq was my favourite company on this route but it will be a while before i choose kq over other alternatives
372,i found the flight horrible my partners tv didnt work there and back seats not comfy when we called the flight attendant it was over an hour before anyone came that is after the bell was switched off several times i was not sat with my partner and when i asked if it was possible if we could sit together they couldnt be bothered to help
373,airobi to lagos after a 30 hours delay  yes 30 hours but what was most annoying is that the kenya airways staff refused to explain what the problem waswas it mechanical or what turned out the cabin crew were staging industrial action to try to prevent nonkenyan nationals working for the airline but the refusal to explain anything only made passengers more and more angry never want to fly with them again
374,be honest i never got on the airplane got to nairobi for a flight to lagos 05102012 to be told the flight was cancelled and they had no spare airplanes we were told to try again the next day in the ensuing chaos business class passengers with confirmed ticket for another flight nairobi to addis were told the flight was overbooked and full already the airline reflects the airport which is among the worst ive encountered
375,kq is on time i have flown them 12 times over the last few weeks ex nbo to mba and ebb and they are on time boarding commences at least 30 minutes before departure and you may have to sit on the plane for 15 minutes but all flights were in time flights have been very full service has been good no food service just drinks and priority luggage works in ebb our bags were sitting near the conveyor belt having been off loaded first lets hope they can keep it up
376,flew kq return flight from cdg to nbi aug20sep4 flights were about on time but very old run down 767 worse than delta with pathetic seatscomfort and nonexistent inflight entertainment staff looked bored and food was poor with all this youd expect a discount but no 900 euros return and the plane was half empty on 20th
377,we flew from heathrow to nairobi on 4th sep with the flight leaving on time we managed to get extra legroom seats row 12 as my husband is 6 ft 5 and they were fine boarding was fairly structured and the food an evening meal  i chose the veggie option  stuffed peppers was pretty good  hot and tasty with a snack just before landing for breakfast i didnt expect much from the ife from the reviews and wasnt bothered anyway some parts of the cabin were a bit frayed around the edges but no real complaints crew were fairly attentive both internal flights were also fine  a short hop between nairobi and mombassa and vice versa  the first left early the second a few minutes late on both there was time for a snack and a drink with good crew service flying back on 13th from nairobi to heathrow was fine too  left on time but no extra legroom seats this time so a bit cramped for my husband ife was very poor  his seatback tv didnt work and mine was hit and miss again no complaints about food boarding this time was a bit more chaotic and jkia is a horrible airport  cramped chaotic and poor flight information luggage all arrived with no problems too maybe we were just lucky given all the other poor experiences but i cant say there was anything majorly wrong with any of our flights or the service we received
378,i was scheduled to fly from chicago to brussels and take brussels air to nairobi july 5th ord flight was late missed connection rerouted through london london to nairobi via kenya airlines one checked bag did not arrive twice kenya air made arrangements to deliver bag while i was in country twice they failed to show repeated attempts to contact them after i returned were futile six weeks later united calls and says they have my bag
379,flew on a 767 from cdg to nbo on july 19th and then a 777 from nbo to ams on august 17th flight from paris to nairobi showed as being on time for 11am departure but bit by bit departure was pushed back until 3pm without any explanation whatsoever once on board 767 both avod devices did not work making 8hour journey feel even longer food was average same as most us carriers and service was kind on return flight we were once again delayed for one hour without explanation and once again avod in both seats did not work food on return flight was less than pleasant i did not have high expectations but kenya airways made even mainstream us carriers look luxurious
380,i live in kenya and i am a flying blue gold member unfortunately i have to fly kq frequently i say unfortunately mainly due to the more than frequent delays without explanations without anyone responsible and without real support as to what to do you feel totally lost in the horrible jkia when flights get delayed over night people are ferried to hotels in cbd instead of hotels closer to the airport apart from this standing joke on kq unreliability of flights i have to say that i have always received my luggage touch wood inflight entertainment is a complete joke with old movies on the system that only works half the time twice in business nboparis i had no inflight entertainment at all and no apologies for it food is not too bad seats are old and uncomfortable now if kq would at least be a cheap airline i could accept all this but given the pricing structure it is just annoying 1000 in econ nbo to maputo i have seen worse but i have also seen much better
381,a pleasant surprise with this airline i made sure i bought travel insurance and examined the policy wording after reading these reviews on this site however from hkgbkkhkg it was clean efficient and with good service outbound flight delayed by 45 minutes but inward was on time luggage and checkin fast and efficient too although couldnt checkin online the price we paid made this a budget airline purchase effectively and we treated as such would be happy to fly with them again if we found a good deal
382,flew them last month from lusakanairobi and return on old boeing 767s while going flight was via lillongwe and on return via harare both ways seats were broken and quite uncomfortable staff were not friendly at all cabin and toilets were quite dirty food both ways was also horrible on return in nairobi checkin staff gave me 2 boarding passes one for the nairobiharare flight and the other for the harare lusaka flight meaning i had to change seats in harare never seen that in any other airline recommend to avoid this airline if possible and use alternatives when flying to and from africa such as saaet
383,flight from nairobi to kigali cancelled with no notice and no reason rebooked on later flight via bujumbura stayed on the ground at bujumburra for 2 hours no luggage on arrival and no one cared phone call on a saturday resulted in call back monday we dont have staff to chase luggage on the weekend in air service was good on all our kenya airways flights but poor schedule management and incredibly bad luggage management means i will not fly again if i can help it such a pity it could be a great airline
384,flew dubai to nairobi to dubai both ways cramped stuffy no ife and filthy conditions also on return flight no reading light and arm rest broken flight from nairobi to dubai had been cancelled a month before but not informed staff made us feel that it was our fault kept waiting for hours before we could speak to someone in authority no genuine interest shown by staff will not be using the pride of kenya again
385,flight to johannesburg expected departure at 910 called kq five minutes away from jkia and informed of delayed departure 1140 checked in and informed of another delayed departure to 12 noon boarded for departure at 12 noon captain announces that we must wait for passengers connecting from new delhi crew advise that they have no idea how long this will take we finally depart at 1240 kq did not know that there were passengers arriving from new delhi all along the flight scheduled for 7am had not left thus passengers booked for this flight still stuck with everyone else what exactly is happening  now informed that the johannesburgnairobi 1055 never actually exist and has never flown  but kq will nevertheless book you on this flight and demand usd 80 for any attempt to change is this still the pride or the embarrassment of africa in as far as this route is concerned a number of kenyans flying on this route frequently advise that you need to stay away from kenya airways i hope that the return trip will be without delay
386,im writing from the jkia airport in nairobi still stuck for 24 hours without any explanation from management there was a 5 hour delay for all flights after that operations at the airport resumed to normal but kenya airways kept telling us we would depart every 3 hours until 1am when passengers became angry and had to storm the first class lounge of kenya airways so someone from management could be called to explain the reason for the long delay needless to say no one showed up some passengers with children have been stuck at the airport for 2 days some passengers  not all have been given food on average i would say that in the last 24 hours passengers have had 1 meal here we are paying 1100 from nairobi to accra but this service is pathetic
387,checked in with seats assigned near the front trip from the seychelles back to nairobi for our connection back to lhr on ba boarded only to be told to forget the seat assignment it became an easyjet  ryanair fiasco this happened on the nairobiseychelles route too i fly a lot and i must say the crew were without doubt the most miserable and rudest crew ive come across on a positive note the food was quite good and the movie for a short flight was welcome the crew and boarding let the whole thing down this was a 3 hour economy flight from nairobi to mahe both ways torn between yes and no for recommendation as pros and cons
388,y disappointing indeed as a kenyan i wanted to believe that kenya airways is indeed the pride of africa perhaps it was at a time recently it is starting to be an embarrassment of africa service has deteriorated to poor levels our departure to dubai was delayed for almost 3 hours we were bundled out of the business lounge only to spend another hour waiting and without any airline staff explaining the cause of delay or if indeed we were going to travel they passed to and fro without having the courtesy to explain my experience in the morning from mombassa was a joke
389,update of my previous review rebooked flight out of joburg at 1115 on 17th april was cancelled with no advance notice sent customer service not at all fazed by further inconvenience to passengers given access to lounge after a vigorous complaint today 27th april 2012 tried online checkin for return flight not too surprised to receive the message your reservation does not exist called call centre in nairobi only to be told my return reservation did not exist eventually it was resolved am now awaiting the right ticket by email
390,a nightmare out of johannesburg on 16th april flight due to take off at 1320 at 1345 the captain announced 9 passengers needed to disembark the aircraft in order to balance the load a few passengers opted for the us500 voucher in exchange for disembarking however an hour later the aircraft hadnt moved chief fa then informs passengers that another 10 passengers have to be offloaded eventually all passengers had to disembark the aircraft and reboard so calculations could be reconciled with the regulations at 1630 after a frustrating 3 hour wait i voluntarily disembarked was taken to the baggage hall to collect my bag only to find all passengers baggage had not even been loaded onto the aircraft staff lied and tried to pass the buck at every opportunity i have now been rebooked on 17th april and am not expecting a better show from kq
391,heathrow to harare return outbound flight was okay with no delays and the flight was comfortable return flight was a nightmare we were delayed twice  once in harare and nairobi with no explanation for the delays
392,airobi to lagos boarding procedures unpleasant sat in a window seat with a passenger next to me who had little appreciation of personal space and who loved what i was watching on my ipad food was great took 3 requests to get a drink after food service finished would see if i could afford business class next time
393,have had very poor experiences in the past but kenya airways seems to be stepping up their game recent flights to juba addis kigali maputo and joburg were all on time seatsplanes were ok new embraers are great and service very good staff are almost always polite
394,helpful crew but awful aeroplanes on lhrnbo route in contrast to those internally used between nairobientebbenairobi and mombassa charming staff wheelchaired me onto flight from entebbe to nairobi and did the same to catch a plane on to mombassa ground staff at mombassa failed to explain luggage was ticketed through to lhr while of course on arrival in kenya luggage is collected and then reinserted for an internal flight onboard 40f did not recline and the video did not work a seat change produced a screen that worked and earphones with insufficient output to listen to the film misery on long flights
395,fight from kigali to nairobi cancelled they gave me a flight the next day meaning i had to spend 24 hours in kigali which i was transiting through i missed two connections paris and washington dc they put me on a flight that required 8 hrs layover in nairobi and refused to offer lounge access the seat they gave me was by the exit arm rest was removed and i had to hold the tray table on my knees every time i needed it a huge 767 no entertainment system food was as terrible as the service
396,heathrow to nairobi return on time in both directions food ok going out but poor on return ife not working on outward journey the b777 was very stuffy and with poor seats it was difficult to sleep ba does this flight better
397,heathrow to nairobi return on time in both directions food ok going out but poor on return ife not working on outward journey the b777 was very stuffy and with poor seats it was difficult to sleep ba does this flight better
398,when our flight was delayed due to the snow 3 weeks ago kenya airways couldnt have been more helpful we were given breakfast and lunch vouchers a room in a hotel until we were able to fly later on in the day and buses were laid on to ferry us backwards and forwards from the terminal staff were courteous and helpful
399,heathrow to nairobi return business cabin comfortable and food good staff charming and helpful cabin can get very stuffy daylight flight preferable very happy to travel ka again
400,five of us travelled from nairobi to mombassa return what can you say about a 45 mins flight take off seat ok drink served with polite crew
401,lhrnbo return economy in uncomfortable and cramped seats that made sleep impossible in different seats for outward and inbound flights but inflight entertainment system was broken on both legs b777 fairly modern but worn buttons on the entertainment system suggested it had been broken for some time cabin staff promised to come back but never did later used crew call button but this was ignored food was poor with breakfast just a bread roll and jam cramped hot and stuffy nairobi airport wasnt much fun either
402,have returned recently from mombassa  outbound journey not as bad as last year seats still very uncomfortable internal flights via nairobi to mombassa  crew were helpful and happy not so on our night flight back to the uk crew rude and unhelpful inedible food
403,comoros hah to johannesburg jnb via nairobi nbo a terrible experience  firstly checkin in comoros is chaotic secondly i and about 6 others were downgraded from business to economy class without apology or explanation thirdly i and the other downgraded passengers had to search around the crowded economy cabin to find a spare seat  cabin crew did not show any interest sympathy and did not help
404,lhr to nbo and juba return excellent flights in both directions 777200 on lhrnbo legs with comfortable if slightly worn lie flat beds excellent cabin service throughout nbojuba in new emb 170 in economy but good food and drinks faultless service despite the chaos of juba airport
405,boams checked in online baggage drop very efficient b777200 with relatively new interior and functioning ife flight left on time and arrived in ams 30 mins early cabin crew were friendly and informative the food was wellseasoned and hot drinks available throughout arrival in ams was smooth and i had my baggage within 10 mins of landing it is unfortunate that kq is unable to provide this experience every single time that accounts for the low ratings and terrible reviews
406,frequent traveller between nboebb good mannered and helpful staff left 10 mins ahead of schedule and arrived on time this is unique given frequent delays on this route will the improvement hold
407,lhr to nbo boeing 777 could feel the seat framework through the upholstery ife didnt work entire control unit in armrest out of action so when the cabin lights were switched off at 10pm i couldnt even switch the light on to read my book cabin staff unhelpful and surly drinks only offered with meals so only twice on a 9 hour flight return flight also 777 different experience completely  staff nice seats fine ife worked came round with drinks several times internal flights from nairobi to mombasa and return were fine
408,lhr to nairobi flight left on time and arrived early seat 31 back row but only 2 seats were comfortable enough and reclined ok food very good and fas good night flight so not bothered about ife return left on time and arrived early food not so good same excellent seats all in all very pleasantly surprised after reading some awful comments would use again
409,johannesburg to nairobi checkin at oliver tambo is a disaster i had checked in online but despite this i had to checkin at the machine as well as the checkin counter the printout from the online checkin as well as the boarding pass printed by the machine are both promptly torn up by the checkin agent who then prints the final boarding pass trolleys are not allowed in the queues for security reasons when all other airlines operating from the same terminal allow trolleys to be pushed right up to the checkin counter flight itself is poor old aircraft with many broken seats and badly trained staff
410,johannesburg from london fairly easy to book and good at checkin food served on londonnairobi trip was awful  the local ugali was served this is not something you serve unless fresh and especially not on an airline we were delayed disembarking in nairobi we waited on the tarmac for the buses to take us to the terminal worse was that it was a cold night would not recommend this airline in its current state it needs urgent and drastic overhaul
411,london to nairobi was an ok experience from there it went right down hill arrived at nairobi to the news that my onward connection to kigali had been cancelled so an extended stay at the worst international airport i have ever been in combine that with less than helpful staff made for a very miserable 45 hours onward flight was in a modern comfortable airplane but no compensation for the nairobi experience will definitely be seeking an alternative route next time
412,from nairobi to addis ababa via djibouti i must say that was the worst flight that i have ever been on the seats didnt recline enough for one to say that they were in business class the seating was just uncomfortable and the seats were small the cabin crew helped by providing a fairly good service other then that the flight was just a drag and when i landed in addis ababa my back was hurting that was my first and definitely last time flying with kenya airways
413,flew from kenya to bangkok service and food was good ife was below average half the channels did not work the bathrooms at least this time had enough toilet paper and hand towels service has a long way to go before it reaches other airline levels jomo kenyatta a very old and tired airport
414,kgl via bjm well timed flights good aircrafts  operated an embraer 190 jet new and comfortable had a hot breakfast with an option of chicken beef and veggie the crew were young and friendly captain kept us well informed on reports on turbulence
415,london heathrow to nairobi on christmas day the flight was cancelled and we flew the following morning we were left in a fair amount of chaos only by following other passengers did we find our way out of the airport to the heathrow hilton our luggage was left overnight in the hold the hilton had more or less run out of food there was one representative from the airline at the hotel reception to inform us of what was happening the following day once onboard the food was awful stale breakfast when we should have had lunch the food from the previous day screens for entertainment didnt work on our return flight the loos were blocked awful food this airline really needs to raise its game
416,business class between nairobi and heathrow good both ways charming staff comfortable seats and a great effort to provide food for a gluten free vegetarian flights on time entertainment limited but overall pleasantly surprised
417,lhrnbo economy sat on the plane for 3hrs at lhr while recurrent electrical problem was fixed they kept us well informed of the situation but it turned an 8hr flight into an 11hr journey all the negatives are well documented here my conclusion pay the extra for ba or vs or if you have time emirates via dubai economy product isnt up to much nbolhr business paid for a last minute upgrade at nbo business cabin is light and airy with only 28 seats on the 777200 with the cabin half empty comfortable fully adjustable chair which turns into a 75 inch flat bed meals served on china and of a good quality and drinks readily available only gripe is the awful avod at 500 for the upgrade i felt this represented value for money and such a far cry from the outbound horrors in economy
418,lhrnbohre flight from london to nairobi was terrible barely enough leg room the entertainment system did not work and the crew was rude and offish flight from nairobi to harare was much better although there was no inflight entertainment overall i would only recommend this airline if the flight is intracontinental rather than intercontinental
419,darnboams both flights departed on time however staff on both flights were not particularly friendly or thoughtful  what a difference with our inward flight to nairobi with klm food on nboams was a disappointment with dry buns for breakfast and a salad for lunch received one drink directly after take off but after that no more refreshments for 5 hours flight entertainment system on the 8 hrs nboams flight was not working  system spontaneously reset itself several times during the flight or it didnt work at all overall very disappointing and what a shame that kenya airways is a code sharing partner of klm
420,bo to accra to my surprise flight was overbooked many who had tickets could not fly flight itself was pleasant with friendly attendants food ok seat on the aisle next to exit could not recline though legroom was good however this was shattered when our luggage was left  many passengers affected almost 2 hours waiting in line in accra just to report this 3 days down the line still waiting good airline but becoming sloppy
421,airobi to harare in business class on a new embraer 190s excellent aircraft for regional flights individual touch screens with limited choice of movies and music but sufficient given the length of the journey quite good food and very friendly crew but they left behind over 100 passengers luggage in nairobi including mine no airline staff were available no compensation and rather unprofessional handling agent at harare airport nairobi airport  probably ok in 1980s but was crowded dirty and not up to standards for 2011
422,boams departure time was 810am but just before takeoff we had to go back to the gate to switch planes which took a good 3 hrs flight took off around 12pm crew did not provide any refreshments during the 4 hr delay onboard crew were rude and seemed disinterested in serving passengers the food was fair the entertainment was not working the crew seemed more interested in chit chatting at the back on the plane than serving us overall i was totally dissatisfied with this airline
423,melbourne to zambia via bangkok through nairobi flight from bangkok to nairobi was delayed without any apologies or explanation flight attendants were not friendly and not even a smile from them i asked for some headphones and 4 hours later i reminded her and she just threw them at me my flight from nairobi to lusaka was also delayed without any apologies again my return trip was the same
424,lhrnb0hre return  b777 and b737800 the aircraft was modern but seemed a bit tired inside the cabin boarding was efficient from lhr but chaotic at nbo the ife had very limited choices the cabin crew were semi efficient but at times seemed rude however i found the meals to be good and their complimentary gifts for my kids made for a pleasant flights indeed seating and legroom is fair overall a decent airline i would use again
425,london to nairobi the worst airline i have ever used departure delayed by more than 12 hours almost no staff to help us rude unsmiling and unhelpful when they did appear inflight entertainment didnt work on the way out or on the return flight a week later food awful no legroom either
426,amsterdamnairobi flight left and arrived on time food despite not looking appetising actually quite tasty staff relatively efficient seat back entertainment didnt work properly seemed to be hit and miss for most passengers im 5ft 10 and i found seating on the 767 to be incredibly cramped much more so than the return flight on klm that and the position of the entertainment box under my b seat made it physically impossible to find a position in which to sleep
427,as per the previous review i was traveling on the cancelled 2345 flight from nairobi to heathrow as part of a round trip the flights in both directions were reasonably good the entertainment systems were broken for most of the seats but staff were pleasant and helpful and food was good unfortunately the reaction to the cancelled flight was awful and the worst treatment i have ever received from an airline as the previous reviewer says the staff were very slow extremely ill informed and seem to have lied on occasion almost no effort was made to inform passengers as to what they needed to do in terms of changing flights getting back through immigration control and sorting out a hotel this resulted in a great deal of frustration and wasted time queuing in the wrong places in particular the airline made very little effort to help passengers find hotel accommodation only one member of staff was available to help and passengers including us were told that there was no hotel accommodation left available which was later proved to be untrue when a number of passengers complained and were miraculously found hotel rooms i suspect the lack of hotel rooms may have related rather more to a lack of appetite to pay the room rates rather than any genuine shortage ultimately we along with perhaps a third of the passengers ended up sleeping on the floor of the transit lounge until we were told to get up and move at around 6am the rescheduled flight was then further delayed when the first officer did not turn up for work at this point refreshments were provided but not enough for all the passengers all in all a consistent and depressing display of incompetence
428,airobilhr i recently was unfortunate to have flown kenya airways flying nairobi to heathrow on the 2345 flight we were told after we had all proceeded through the gate that it had been cancelled this was at midnight 2 staff were available to book over 200 people onto new flights they were slow rude and lied about when they were able to do they were very slow to provide any refreshments and were not able to accommodate everyone in hotels until the flights the following day  so we had to sleep on the floor when i finally got a flight home the food was substandard the staff were rude and surly toilets were not cleaned or maintained i will never be flying this airline again
429,lhr to nairobi punctual departure and arrival clean spacious 777 good leg room inflight entertainment not working food lamb stew with very overcooked veg  second rate school dinners completely unsmiling cabin crew who knocked my arm i was in an aisle seat every time they passed loos not tidied or cleaned during flight 85 hours
430,antananarivo to nairobi flight arrived at ivato airport to be told flight cancelled check in staff had no idea why or when they would be able to get me to nairobi on the next flight they said when will that be i asked i dont know in the next few days was the reply i was sent to the carlton hotel to wait to be recalled at hotel discovered that a room had been booked for me for four nights however message received at hotel to be ready for transport to airport the next day at 800am arrived at ivato 830am checkin didnt open till 1015am once checked in to nairobi i was casually told that my london connection was booked for two days later after some minutes of discussion they transferred me to that evenings london connection which involves nine hours in nairobi airport
431,i write this sitting in an airport lounge having just disembarked from the only trip that i have ever taken using kenya airways  it is awful the outbound flight there was no individual entertainment system just a single main screen movie that was impossible to watch the seats were uncomfortable food awful and not enough the return flight used a newer aircraft but that only meant that the seats were even closer together making it a long and painful trip even though the newer aircraft had individual entertainment system it was lacking features and mine did not work they could not even turn it off so that i could sleep so i had this white screen glaring at me all through the night the crew are poor  10 minutes before landing i asked what terminal we would arrive at and they did not know if you have a choice to use another airline then please do
432,good points are that we left on time and boarding was well organised service onboard was awful on both flights the entertainment system was not working and despite asking over and over again no one had the courtesy to come back to me on the outward flight the service was a disgrace  no drink for an hour then it came with the meal i had asked twice for a drink and was told 2 minutes the plane was tired  carpets rucked up and loose seats dirty and stained
433,flights delayed no customer service and poor communication sullen and unhelpful staff passengers were treated more like cattle and staff acted more like those of a budget airline
434,check in was chaotic and the ground manager seemed more concerned about whether the flight was full than the brusque attitude of the checkin staff even at business checkin onboard the seats were comfortable and the service of the business crew was attentive without being over powering the drinks were flowing the food high quality with an excellent breakfast the journey was smooth the blanket could have been better and the utility set was not to the standard i would expect from business the entertainment was ok but there was insufficient choice enjoyed the flight but still improvements that could be made
435,fihnbocdg all flights on time i was surprised that they did not make any welcome announcements before takeoff very unusual food was great on the first leg 737800 service was quick and efficient the nairobi jomo kenyatta airport is getting better every day with new seating areas boarding was slow on the paris flight food good with a new kq menu a nice touch for economy class passengers the cabin was however too cold so passengers did not have a good night sleep good flights overall and friendly staff
436,boams plane scheduled to leave at 810am at 12pm no boarding no announcement passengers started asking questions and an announcement came that the crew had not arrived we ended up leaving more than 7hrs later the tv on the plane did not work making an already 8 hr long journey almost unbearable
437,lhr  nbo return on a b777 departed and arrived on time no problems with bags the food was average with a full meal followed later by a snack going to nbo on the trip north a small snack at the start of the trip and a small breakfast at the end the cabin crew was fine the plane was in good condition the entertainment system had limited range of programs the only major issue was the boarding procedure at nairobi airport the passengers were squeezed into a tiny departure lounge for a long time the boarding process was a mess with announcements and ground staff contradicting each other i would happily use them again
438,boams on b777 mixed experience we were almost 1 hr late departing nairobi with no explanations or apologies arrived in ams almost on time breakfast was average with a hot lunch which was quite good ife was a bit unstable but kept me entertained had an onwards connection in ams with klmcph that i made but my luggage didnt delivered next day at my home in copenhagen
439,jnbnbo cabin crew were warm and friendly food was very good ife was average but they can do much better the duty free was surprisingly good
440,antanatarivo to niarobi 4 hr flight left on time service was good and cabin staff attentive food was average with ok leg room cabin and toilets clean first time on kq and was pleasantly surprised however this was shorthaul  longhaul experience was awful
441,airobi to ldn economy seat 33c and 24b boarding a little chaotic and some sat in the boarding lounge for 90 mins staff were sufficiently attentive food adequate av worked and toilets very clean arrived on time seating 24b was very poor no leg room and uncomfortable moved to 33c aisle seat limited recline and impossible to sleep avoid kq economy long haul short haul however is good
442,we were quite disappointed by our first experience of kenya airways on our recent trip from london to nairobi  my husbands tv wasnt working and although we asked for help that was simply ignored the staff looked bored and were not very attentive you had to be quick to say that you wanted coffeetea as you only had one chance much too early during dinner the food wasnt great but edible i was also annoyed by the fact that they didnt encourage other passengers to put their seats forward when food was served  that meant we had even less space whilst having our breakfast the flight back was not quite as bad but still i felt the staff could have made more of an effort occasional smile would be nice the thing i would really like to criticise was the boarding procedure at nairobi airport  we were asked to board 15 hours before departure which meant that we were squeezed into a tiny departure lounge for that length of time  the boarding was a mess with the announcements and ground staff contradicting each other  despite the early boarding time we still managed to leave late
443,cabin crew in economy not very communicative they seem to forget it is their job to be polite and helpful flying in economy is stressful especially when most of the time the entertainment system doesnt work toilets are left dirty towards the end of the flight and if you want duty free items you have to watch for when they come by or you will miss them food was awful with very limited choice tea and coffee service is poor
444,flew kq in business nbojnb using points we were on the 8pm flight check in was very easy with no queue the lounge in nbo is small and crowded we boarded by bus cram as many people in as you can on board 737800 only 516 seats occupied food was good there was one starter no choice choice of 2 main courses and then desert or cheese preplated wine was excellent service was good glasses were always topped up we never use kq ife always carry our own ipad and bose noise cancelling headphones kq gave a basic amenity kit arrival into jnb was 30 mins early luggage took 15 mins to come out overall pleasant experience
445,it was a mombasanairobi flight schedule to leave at 1440h so we arrived at the airport by 1315h and checked in they did not say one word to us about the delay they didnt tell us anything but simply put it up on the board after we had waited for 2 hrs already without any announcement or explanation of course it did not leave until 1840h kq will allow you to book and check in then they will not service the flight leaving you effectively grounded and waiting for up to 5 hrs for a local flight pure inefficiency
446,lhrnbo had read on here from many posters that the ife is grossly unreliable and not surprisingly i struck the same with the entire side of the plane without ife no compensation but nottoo bothered as was an overnight flight and i slept arrival procedure in nairobi bordering on chaotic with visa process etc and baggage hall a shambles but not fault of airline having made the choice over bavs to see something different i was satisfied staff were surprisingly good
447,he seats were neat and clean and food was excellent our flight from johannesburg to nairobi couldnt land at nairobi the plane landed at mombasa where passengers were kept in the airport for 4 hrs without foodwater kenyan airways and airport staff were not able to manage angry passengers we were taken to nairobi the next morning i missed all my schedules staffs are not prepared they lack coordination with each other
448,staff completely uninterested and uninformed especially ground staff who upon being confronted with the slightest challenge turn their back and leave always delays very filthy toilets overpriced tickets especially within africa business class lounge is average
449,bofih checkin at the jomo kenyatta airport was slow as usual with long lines starting outside the terminal flight on time on a 767300 for some reason ife was not available but i did not mind as the flight was 3 hrs a nice hot breakfast was served after take off by a very friendly almost all male cabin crew great flight overall  with good standards and professional crew for an african airline
450,london to nairobi  excellent flight good service comfortable seat decent leg room i am 510 food could be better good entertainment system i would happily use them again onward to mombassa also fine delayed coming back at mombassa  not airlines fault  but connection held and most of time made up and free refreshments when delayed so overall did well despite difficulties
451,jnbnbojnb this trip showed both the good and average sides of this airline jnbnbo was on time inflight service was good and the 737800 used was clean and comfortable nbojnb was a different story upon arrival at nairobi airport i was informed that i had been rebooked on a later flight instead as a result the boarding process took a long time and the flight was delayed about 30mins the 767 used on this leg was in good shape with a smart blue leather interior and a good seat pitch the ife was a bit dated with the oldstyle projector meal choices were a bit odd for breakfast but the service was prompt
452,airobilondon lounge in nairobi was small and food poor but for nairobi airport standards it was ok very surprised they only started boarding 25mins before departure usually its much earlier but we managed to leave bang on time welcome by cabin crew was warm seat was comfortable in sitting position seat nice and wide when converted into a bed its angle is 170 degrees but you cant stretch your legs fully and im only 58 which means any position for a long period of time is uncomfortable in flight entertainment was poor  avod but very limited selection of films lots of features seemed to be broken  whether it was the control or the individual system it was unclear food was a mixture  lunch was excellent beautifully presented but the afternoon tea which they copied it seems from ba was appalling  sandwiches were dry rolls with slabs of butter and unidentifiable filling scone was cold and dry cabin crew were good but not excellent  they were courteous and warm but very slow which was disappointing as the cabin was almost empty so they had only a few passengers to serve and it still took an age for them to respond to any request or to complete each round of the meal service i would be very frustrated if the cabin had been full disappointingly there was absolutely no interaction with pax from crew overall the flight was reasonably comfortable and smooth but not good value for money as it was an award ticket i cant complain too much but i would certainly not pay a business class fare for the premium product kenya airways offers
453,airobilondon as me and my wife are both wheelchair passengers for which we charged 10 each by the nairobi office it was a very disappointing experience at london heathrow there were no wheelchairs on arrival at heathrow i had to wait 40 mins before the ground staff could arrange for a wheelchair or a buggy in the end we had to walk half the distance with one wheel chair for me no wheel chair for my wife although 10 was paid there was no inflight entertainment i tried to talk to the purser but heshe did not bother we have flown kenya airways many times and competition airlines as well seems that the airline in looking for profits is ignoring the comfort of passengers although a shareholder of the company i do not expect the service to be comprised to support our national airline another area i would like to point out is no refresher kit is given to economy class passengers if i had known we would have brought ours and create profit for the airline
454,lunllw in economy adequate for a 1 hr trip fa were friendly there was a quick distribution of nuts and drinks and ptvs ive always found that you when you ask for a canned drink you get given two of them  a small touch that ive always liked
455,i fly kenya very often almost once every 2 weeks and usually business on the route nairobimombasa i find the staff both ground and flight attendants quite friendly the aircraft are usually in good condition usually ex klm 737s the domestic flight food quality is quite poor the real problem with kqs domestic flight is the lack of a lounge in the domestic side jkia is kqs hub but it looks more like an outdated bus terminal nairobi needs urgently a new airport
